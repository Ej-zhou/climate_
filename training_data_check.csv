However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.",academic,,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,10.1007/s11104-024-06598-7,WOS:001182513700001,,,,,,Silicon promotes biomass accumulation in <i>Phragmites australis</i> under waterlogged conditions in coastal wetland,siliconpromotesbiomassaccumulationiniphragmitesaustralisiunderwaterloggedconditionsincoastalwetland,2024.0,PLANT AND SOIL,,[],"{'wos': {'AB': ""Aims Previous studies have shown that silicon (Si) can affect plant growth and yield by regulating the availability of other nutrients.

This study investigates the co-gasification of straw and RDF to optimize syngas production and minimize undesired by-products. The optimization of the S/M ratio and gasification temperature is crucial for efficient RDF gasification. The optimal S/M ratio and temperature balance syngas yield, quality (LHV), and process efficiency (carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency), while minimizing environmental hazards from solid residues. The carbon conversion efficiency of co-gasification of RDF increased by 12.7 % at the S/ M 0 f 0.75 and gasification temperature of 800 degrees C, a significant improvement compared to the efficiencies observed for the separate gasification of straw and RDF. Additionally, the gas yield and the cold gas efficiency were increased by 14.43 % and 26.42 % compared to the separate gasification processes, respectively.

The motivation behind this research is to enhance the properties of polyamide 12 (PA12) by integrating biochar, a sustainable material derived from biomass, to improve both performance and environmental impact. A detailed structure-property correlation analysis was conducted to assess the effects of biochar on PA12's morphology, mechanical behavior, crystallinity, thermal stability, viscoelastic performance, and environmental sustainability. Key findings include successful PA12 synthesis, confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Increased biochar content led to a decrease in molecular weight and an increase in crystallinity from 27 % to 38 %, suggesting enhanced nucleation effects. SEM analysis showed excellent dispersion and compatibility of biochar within the PA12 matrix, leading to significant improvements in tensile strength (from 38 f 1 MPa to 54 f 2 MPa) and modulus (from 745 f 30 MPa to 2055 f 65 MPa).

To explore the effects of SLR projections on net CO2 uptake in coastal marshes, we conducted a ""double-check"" investigation, including the eddy covariance (EC) measurements of the CO2 fluxes in subtropical coastal marshes along inundation and salinity gradients, in combination with a mesocosm experiment for analyzing CO2 flux components under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. During the same measurement periods, the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEEEC based on the EC dataset) in an oligohaline marsh was higher than that in a low-elevation mesohaline marsh, whereas the NEEEC was lower than that in a high-elevation freshwater marsh. The declines in NEEEC between the marshes could be attributed to a greater decrease in gross primary production relative to ecosystem respiration. Waterlogging slightly increased the NEEms (NEE based on the mesocosms) because of inhibited soil respiration and slight changes in plant photosynthesis and shoot respiration. However, the NEEms measured during the drainage period decreased significantly due to the stimulated soil respiration. The NEEms decreased with increasing salinity (except under mild salinity), and waterlogging exacerbated the adverse impacts of salinity. The amplificatory effect of decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and growth under hydrological stresses contributed more to reduce the NEEms than to respiratory effluxes. Both water logging and increased salinity reduced the root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and activities of assayed soil enzymes (except for cellulase under waterlogging conditions), leading to limited soil respiration. The declines in plant growth, photosynthesis, and soil respiration could also be attributed to the decrease in soil nutrients under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions.

Green areas mitigate air pollution, reduce the temperature, and promote infiltration to feed the aquifers that, in the case of Mexico City, supply 68% of the water. Additionally, food production and recreational usage are important for the population. In the years 2017 and 2018, the chemical composition of wet deposition in the southern part of Mexico City was analyzed, daily and weekly. The study area is located in the greenest part of Mexico City, an important site for water recharge and carbon sequestration. Mexico City, like other megacities of high- and low-income countries, faces serious problems of air pollution.

Moreover, GB increased the protein levels of p-AKT and Bcl2, while decreased the protein levels of MST1, p-p38, p-JNK, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, exogenous Netrin-1 alleviated X-ray-induced ROS production and apoptosis, whereas knockout of Netrin-1 receptor DCC abolished the protective effect of GB.ConclusionOxidative stress and MST1-mediated neuronal apoptosis participated in radiation-induced cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, and modulation of DCC by GB was an effective intervention against RBI."

[Method] Based on the survey data of coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest in Jiaohe, Jilin Province of northeastern China from 2010 to 2020, the relationship between biotic factors (species diversity, structural diversity, species asynchronism, stand density) and abiotic factors (topographic factors, soil physical and chemical properties) and community biomass stability at 20 m * 20 m and 40 m * 40 m spatial scales and their mechanism were investigated by structural equation model. [Result] At the scale of 20 m * 20 m, biomass stability was significantly positively correlated with species asynchrony, structural diversity, and stand density. Among abiotic factors, topographic factors (slope and convexity) were positively correlated with biomass stability. At the scale of 40 m * 40 m, biomass stability was positively correlated with species asynchrony, while soil physicochemical properties (available potassium, total phosphorus and available nitrogen) were negatively correlated with biomass stability. The structural equation model analysis showed that the effect of species asynchrony on biomass stability was higher than that of stand density and structural diversity at the scale of 20 m * 20 m, and the path coefficient was 0.40.

We surveyed spontaneous vegetation in 16 vineyards and 16 olive groves in the French Mediterranean region with contrasting pedoclimatic conditions and agricultural practices, during spring and fall 2021. Four leaf traits were measured: Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC), Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) and leaf C/N ratio (Leaf C/N) and four forage potential indicators: dry matter digestibility (DMD), crude proteins (CP), neutral detergent fiber content (NDF) and aboveground biomass (AB). We found that DMD of perennial agroecosystems weeds is high (689 +/- 116 g kg-1), and can be compared to those of forage species. Using linear mixed models and path analysis, we found that, at the community scale, LDMC is negatively linked to weed forage quality and that disturbing agricultural practices like tillage, increase weed forage quality. However we did not find any effect of agricultural practices or pedoclimate on weeds leaf traits or on weeds quantity. Our results revealed the potential of weeds as highly digestible forage resources for livestock.

In this research, using the soil health framework, we assessed the impact of native forest conversion to anthropic systems (planted forests, pastures, and monocultures) on two ecosystem services: biodiversity conservation and soil fertility in the highlands of northern Ecuador. The biological dimension of our assessment focused on the diversity, abundance, and biomass of soil macroinvertebrate communities as proxies to soil functions, whereas soil chemical parameters were used to describe the soil fertility.

Reference points are often classified as limit reference points, which indicate an undesirable state, or target reference points, which specify a desirable one. Limit reference points frequently indicate a state for which the reproductive potential of the stock is impacted, and are thus based on spawning output. Spawning output is also used in the stock-recruitment curve, which is a key component of stock-assessment models. We investigated the effect on stock assessment results of metrics of spawning output that are used either in the stock-recruitment relationship or to evaluate reference points. We use yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean as an example. The metrics biomass of mature females and fecundity attribute higher reproductive potential to the older ages, while numbers of mature females and summary biomass attribute more to the younger ages. Both the stock assessment results and the evaluation of reference points are sensitive to the metric used.

Urban green space (UGS) can provide local cooling effect and reduce UHI. However, there still lack a comprehensive exploration of the characteristics of UHI and cooling effect of UGS due to high cloud coverage and limited number of available remote sensing observations. In this study, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance data fusion method was employed to develop an enhanced land surface temperature data in winter seasons in three tropical megacities, Dhaka, Kolkata, and Bangkok. The spatiotemporal variations of surface urban heat island (SUHI) were explored from 2000 to 2020 with a 5-years interval. The optimal size of UGS associated with its cooling effects was assessed by using the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE). The relationship between the intensity and range of urban cooling island (UCI) and four landscape metrics of green space patches, total area (P_Area), shape index (P_SI), normalized difference vegetation index (P_NDVI), and land surface temperature (P_LST), were analyzed. The results show that the average SUHI intensity increased by 0.98 degrees C, 1.42 degrees C, and 0.73 degrees C in Dhaka, Kolkata, and Bangkok, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The maximum intensity of UCI ranges from 4.83 degrees C in Bangkok to 8.07 degrees C in Kolkata, and the maximum range of UCI varies from 300 m in Bangkok to 420 m in Kolkata. The optimal size of green space is 0.37 ha, 0.77 ha, and 0.42 ha in Dhaka, Kolkata, and Bangkok, respectively.

Engineering process models for several fuel and co-product pathways were leveraged to perform high fidelity techno-economic analysis. These pathways included: baseline hydrothermal liquefaction; protein extraction followed by hydro thermal liquefaction; fractionation into high-value chemicals with fermentation followed by hydrothermal liquefaction for fuels; and a small-scale first-of-a-kind plant coupled with a wastewater treatment facility. From these models, it was shown that hydrothermal liquefaction as a fuel-only pathway is not economically viable. Likewise, the benefits of coupling with wastewater water treatment are insignificant compared to the impact of reduced facility size resulting in increased capital costs. These models were also used to examine public policy scenarios, uniquely presenting their impact on the breakeven cost of fuel production and sensitivity to scenario assumptions.

Due to discounting, short-term subsidies were found to capture 50% of the subsidy value in 6 years with an additional 24 years required for full subsidy valuation. Integration of a carbon economy was shown to decrease biofuel production costs, particularly for the protein pathway due to the co-product accounting. Finally, a metric of normalized costs was used to compare algal biorefineries to corn and cellulosic ethanol production, showing that algal systems are uniquely different due to significantly higher capital costs, though operational costs are comparable.

In the Anammox reaction, performed under anoxic conditions by autotrophic bacteria, ammonium and nitrite contribute in equimolar amounts to the formation of dinitrogen gas. Anammox bacteria are characterized by low biomass yield because of their autotrophic growth mode and their high maintenance requirement due to their slow growth rate (doubling time of 10-12 days). In addition, nitrite is a substrate for Anammox on one hand and an inhibitor of Anammox microorganisms at some concentrations on the other hand. Next, inorganic carbon limitation is the limiting factor in the growth of nitrifiers and Anammox bacteria. These are the reasons that one-stage reactors are extremely difficult to start-up. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of bicarbonate addition on the changes in nitrogen forms in the one-stage reactor, biofilm composition and overall reactor performance during the adaptation of non-Anammox biomass to nitrogen-rich wastewater. In this study, a one-stage biofilm batch reactor treated the digester supernatant from the full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant.

Anammox bacteria are characterized by low biomass yield because of their autotrophic growth mode and their high maintenance requirement due to their slow growth rate (doubling time of 10-12 days). In addition, nitrite is a substrate for Anammox on one hand and an inhibitor of Anammox microorganisms at some concentrations on the other hand. Next, inorganic carbon limitation is the limiting factor in the growth of nitrifiers and Anammox bacteria. These are the reasons that one-stage reactors are extremely difficult to start-up. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of bicarbonate addition on the changes in nitrogen forms in the one-stage reactor, biofilm composition and overall reactor performance during the adaptation of non-Anammox biomass to nitrogen-rich wastewater. In this study, a one-stage biofilm batch reactor treated the digester supernatant from the full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant. In the supernatant, the average concentrations of pollutants were as follows: 320 +/- 52 mg COD/L, 413 +/- 78 mg TN/L, 328 +/- 46 mg NH4-N/L and 97 +/- 19 mg TP/L. Aerobic granular sludge from the full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant operated with simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was used as inoculum. The operational parameters of the reactor were: working volume 3 L, 8-hour cycle, volumetric exchange ratio 50%/cycle. In one-stage reactors, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) must be selectively pressured to decrease their activity. Therefore, in this reactor, low dissolved oxygen, about 0.5 mg/L, a pH of about 8.0, and a high temperature, about 35 degrees C, were maintained. Apart from determining changes in nitrogen profile, fluorescence in situ hybridization technique indicating the changes in the biofilm composition was used as an indicator of adaptation of the microorganisms to high influent nitrogen concentrations. With the bicarbonate/TN ratio in the influent of about 3.5, stable reactor performance was obtained with the final ammonium concentration in the effluent below 10 mg N-NH4/L. Nitrate was the predominant form of nitrogen in the effluent. In this period, the abundance proportion between Anammox bacteria, ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB dynamically changed in the biomass. This part of biomass that was suspended in the reactor was characterized by good settling abilities, with the sludge volume index below 50 mL/g MLSS."

The environmental impact of PERC modules requires life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the environmental impacts, such as global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential – cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP) of mono-facial and bifacial (dual-glass encapsulation and transparent back-sheet encapsulation) PERC modules prepared using 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers. The rear side gain of a bifacial module increases its electricity generation in the Use stage, and thereby making bifacial module achieve better environmental performance than mono-facial module. In order to improve the rear side gain of bifacial module, it is usually necessary to select an appropriate ground reflective material in system design.

The environmental impact of PERC modules requires life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the environmental impacts, such as global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential – cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP) of mono-facial and bifacial (dual-glass encapsulation and transparent back-sheet encapsulation) PERC modules prepared using 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers. The rear side gain of a bifacial module increases its electricity generation in the Use stage, and thereby making bifacial module achieve better environmental performance than mono-facial module. In order to improve the rear side gain of bifacial module, it is usually necessary to select an appropriate ground reflective material in system design.

As one of the prominent climate change 'hot spots,' the Mediterranean area, especially the eastern portion, is expected to be more vulnerable to heat exposure than other regions due to its high population density and urbanization rate. The Paris Agreement includes the goal of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels'. It is interesting to study how heat extremes would change in the Mediterranean area in a +1.5 degrees C and +2 degrees C global warming world and how they would impact humans and agriculture. Based on high resolution climate scenario data from Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment Mediterranean, we calculate several heat extreme indices to study heat extreme changes in the future. We found that in most Mediterranean areas, both daytime and nighttime heat wave intensity and frequency will have a robust increase in the 21st century compared with that of the historical period, with the most prominent areas located in northwest Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Middle East.

Spatiotemporal models are important tools to explore ecosystem dynamics, but the unpredictable and localized nature of episodic environmental events represents an important challenge for the successful management of marine resources. For instance, red tides on the West Florida Shelf impact marine ecosystems and represent an increasing concern for fisheries management. Therefore, it is important to account for these ecosystem processes using spatiotemporal models and critically assess parametrization to help efficiently implement adaptative management. To accomplish such objectives, I developed a set of ecological niche models (regression and machine learning), a spatiotemporal ecosystem model (Ecopath with Ecosim and Ecospace), and singlespecies stock assessment models (statistical catch-at-age) with emphasis on the West Florida Shelf ecosystem and red tide events. 15 Intrinsic population aspects, sampling effort, environment, and red tides influenced the interpretation of fish environmental niche dynamics. Red tides caused negative effects at the ecosystem, ecosystem service, and population levels in terms of biomass, and the year 2005 was the most severely impacted. The inclusion of sublethal and indirect red tide effects in the Ecospace model revealed compensatory responses on behavior, trophic interactions, and recruitment. When informing stock assessment models, the absence or missparametrization of time-varying natural mortality caused by red tides can bias fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass which may prevent the successful management of fish stocks. This research represents an example of how to evaluate episodic environmental mortality events that require a spatiotemporal framework and produce a robust ecosystem index for use in stock assessment and fisheries management. Uncertainty assessment, stability, validation, and calibration processes for Ecospace model development greatly improved the model robustness and represented a step forward to operationalize spatiotemporal ecosystem models. Spatiotemporal operating models can be useful to assess future red tide scenarios, simulate data, evaluate model parametrization, and inform single-species stock assessment models to support ecosystem-based fisheries management. Increasing the operationalization of ecosystem models may help to achieve a more adaptative and proactive management approach to future red tide events that could be crucial for fisheries management and red tide impact mitigation.",academic,2025-02-25 08:54:41.429607+01:00,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,,PQDT:49265930,,,,,,"Spatiotemporal Ecosystem Dynamics on the West Florida Shelf: Prediction, Validation, and Application to Red Tides and Stock Assessment",spatiotemporalecosystemdynamicsonthewestfloridashelfpredictionvalidationandapplicationtoredtidesandstockassessment,2022.0,,,[],"{'wos': {'AU': ['Vilas, Daniel'], 'BN': '9798802706800', 'C1': 'University of Florida, Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Florida, United; States', 'C3': ['University of Florida'], 'DT': 'Dissertation/Thesis', 'PD': 'Jan 01 2022', 'PT': 'B', 'PY': '2022', 'TC': '0', 'TI': 'Spatiotemporal Ecosystem Dynamics on the West Florida Shelf: Prediction, Validation, and Application to Red Tides and Stock Assessment', 'UT': 'PQDT:49265930', 'Z8': '0', 'Z9': '0', 'ZA': '0', 'ZB': '0', 'ZR': '0', 'ZS': '0'}}",3798656b-31b3-4f62-85cb-13b0302bd9b0,1.0,0.0,sirui.zhu,"Marine species and ecosystems are increasingly impacted by episodic environmental events that affect mortality and behavior.

To address this, I developed ecological niche models (regression and machine learning), a spatiotemporal ecosystem model (Ecopath with Ecosim and Ecospace), and single-species stock assessment models (statistical catch-at-age) focusing on the West Florida Shelf and red tide events. Various factors, including intrinsic population aspects, sampling effort, environment, and red tides, influenced the interpretation of fish environmental niche dynamics. Red tides negatively affected ecosystem biomass, ecosystem services, and populations, with 2005 being the most severely impacted year. Incorporating sublethal and indirect red tide effects in the Ecospace model revealed compensatory responses in behavior, trophic interactions, and recruitment. In stock assessment models, failing to account for time-varying natural mortality due to red tides led to biases in fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass estimates, potentially hindering effective fishery management. This research highlights the importance of spatiotemporal frameworks for evaluating episodic environmental mortality events and developing robust ecosystem indices for stock assessments. Enhancing uncertainty assessment, stability, validation, and calibration in Ecospace model development significantly improved its robustness, advancing the operationalization of spatiotemporal ecosystem models. These models can be used to assess future red tide scenarios, simulate data, refine model parameterization, and inform single-species stock assessments, supporting ecosystem-based fisheries management. Increasing the operationalization of ecosystem models can help achieve a more adaptive and proactive management approach, which is crucial for mitigating red tide impacts on fisheries."

However, biomanipulation is prone to failure if external nutrient loads are not reduced. In order to explore the importance of filter-feeding fish and bivalves on algal control, an outdoor mesocosm experiment was conducted using different nutrient concentrations.

In the present work we have combined sequential extraction processes from Saccharina latissima to produce a range of products, focusing on the extraction of fucoxanthin using supercritical CO2 followed by different valorisation routes. We optimised the conditions the for extraction of fucoxanthin (40 MPa, temperature has little impact on extraction) and the extracts obtained were tested on cancer cell cultures to determine the antiproliferative effects of this pigment. We established that the supercritical CO2 extracts have an antiproliferative effect similar to that of commercial fucoxanthin (concentrations 0.1-0.4 mg/mL) and showed that the active compound in the extracts is fucoxanthin. In order to integrate this process with a holistic valorisation of the algal biomass, we explored the extraction of mannitol using a microwave-assisted protocol (4.15 wt % yield). We also evaluated the potential extraction of fucoidans and alginates from the solids remaining after supercritical CO2 extraction (67.27 to 69.38 % of alginates). A life cycle analysis of the supercritical CO2 extraction proposed shows that the drying process of algal biomass and the energy used to compress the CO2 are the elements with the highest environmental impact (over 90% of CO2 eq/g of extract) in this the process, indicating routes for reducing the environmental footprint. Combining supercritical CO2 extraction and microwave-assisted extraction methods would enable European seaweed producers to obtain multiple marketable products from algal biomass.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

This study shows that mental well-being and burnout levels of women in Turkey have been considerably affected as a result of social distancing measures taken with the first wave of the pandemic. Findings signal the immediate need for targeted mental health nursing interventions. Therefore, technology-based mental health support programmes are recommended to be designed and utilized by mental health nurses."

In this study, we investigated the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of soil water from four different land use types to explore the mechanism of soil water movement and transformation and analyse the influence of land use. The results show that the range of stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) in soil water was smaller than that in precipitation. Values for delta D and delta O-18 in soil water showed relatively similar temporal variation, heavy isotopes were enriched in the soil water in July and depleted in October. Stable isotope values in shallow (<100 cm depth) soil water and deep (>200 cm depth) soil water were low. The delta D and delta O-18 values in woodlands decreased gradually with increasing depth.

However, land plants are also responsible for wet-land assembly and organic carbon burial. The total burial output of carbon via both organic and inorganic deposition must balance input to the exogenic system from volcanic outgassing on million-year time scales. Increased partitioning of carbon burial toward organic carbon and away from inorganic carbon reduces the marine carbonate burial flux, necessitating a lowered total flux of alkalinity to the oceans to maintain mass balance in the Earth's surface carbon cycle. This flux includes the nutrient delivery from the terrestrial vegetation implicated as a driver of marine evolution, extinction, and environmental change including anoxia and black shale formation. Here, the burial of terrestrial organic carbon, first substantially in the Devonian and continuing through to the present, is argued to require a reduction in silicate weathering rates when compared to earlier times, given the independence of volcanic outgassing from weathering on short time scales.

The study focuses on an environmentally friendly hybrid distillation (D)-pervaporation (PV) process to enhance energy efficiency and purity in ethanol–water and isobutanol-water mixtures, these are typical wastes in the chemical industry. Three configurations—D + PV, D + PV + D, and D + PV + D with partial Heat Integration (HI)—are evaluated for separation of ethanol–water and isobutanol-water mixtures employing the Life Cycle Assessment with Environmental Footprint (EF) V3.1 (adapted) and ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H) V1.08 methods, using SimaPro V9.5 software and Ecoinvent V3.9.1 database. The study also incorporates a PESTLE analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to identify the most advantageous process for ethanol and isobutanol scenarios. The research evaluates these systems in a comprehensive manner, including technology, CO2 emissions, impacts on human health, ecosystems, resources, and Total Annual Cost (TAC). The exploration of hybrid process enhancements includes alternative renewable energy sources (i.e., solar, wind, hydro, and biofuel) and comprehensive heat integration based on Pinch Analysis using Hint V2.2 software. Results indicate that D + PV + D is the most suitable for isobutanol-water scenarios based on MCDA and Pinch analysis. In isobutanol scenarios, D + PV + D + HI reduces CO2 emissions, and human health, ecosystems, and resources impact by 15.5 %, 11.2 %, 12.6 %, and 14.6 %, respectively, with a significant 40.0 % decrease in TAC compared to D + PV. Integrating renewable energy sources further enhances its sustainability, achieving a single score of approximately one-third lower than fossil fuel consumption. Promoting renewable energy and Integrating energy flows align seamlessly with Green Chemistry and Engineering principles, representing a crucial stride towards sustainable and eco-friendly industrial practices."

We measured carbon stock in three carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), necromass, and soil. By analyzing tree stands using parameters such as tree height and diameter at breast height within circular plots (7 m in radius, 125 m apart), we gathered fundamental data on forest structure, species composition, and above- and below-ground biomass. Additionally, we collected soil samples at various points and depths, measuring the amount of wood, stems, or branches (necromass) that fell to or died on the forest floor. Data were collected in plots along a line transect, comprising three transects and six circular plots each. Sixteen diverse mangrove species were found, demonstrating rich mangrove biodiversity.

The estimated average deadwood carbon varied between 50 and 91 MgC/ha, while soil carbon ranged from 1200 to 2500 MgC/ha. These findings underscore the significant carbon storage potential of these mangrove forests, highlighting their importance to global carbon cycling and climate change mitigation. This research contributes to a broader understanding of mangroves as vital blue carbon ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of conservation efforts such as forest restoration and rehabilitation to enhance their role in stabilizing coastal areas and improving global climate resilience."

An accurate and reliable seizure prediction system can generate alarm before epileptic seizures to provide patients and their caregivers with sufficient time to take appropriate action. This study proposes an efficient seizure prediction system based on deep learning in order to anticipate the onset of the seizure as early as possible. Handcrafted features extracted based on the prior knowledge and hidden deep features are complementarily fused through the feature fusion module, and then the hybrid features are fed into the multiplicative long short-term memory (MLSTM) to explore the temporal dependency in EEG signals. A one-dimensional channel attention mechanism is implemented to emphasize the more representative information in the multi-channel output of the MLSTM. Finally, a transfer learning strategy is proposed to transfer the weights of the base model trained on the EEG data of all patients to the target patient model, and the latter is then continuously trained using the EEG data of the target patient. The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity of 95.56% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.27/h on the SWEC-ETHZ intracranial EEG data.

ecosystem.Unfortunately,it is frequently full of challenges to capture the distribution of the rare species through traditional methods.Procypris rabaudi is a unique economic species in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,the number of which has declined dramatically in recent years.Environmental DNA technology is a sensitive,low-cost and non-invasive new technology for species monitoring.It has great potential application in detecting endangered and invasive species.In order to establish a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for the detection of P.rabaudi and distinguish it from other fishes in the Yangtze River,this study designed eDNA primers and a TaqMan probe based on 12S rRNA gene sequence in mtDNA.The sequence of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pMD19-T vector to construct the standard plasmid,and a qPCR method was developed for detection of P.rabaudi using serially diluted standard plasmid as templates.Subsequently the sensitivity,specificity and application effects of the method were evaluated.The results showed that the cycle threshold value (Ct) of qPCR assay had a great linear relationship with the copy number of the standard plasmid.Amplification specificity analysis indicated that the method could specifically detect P.rabaudi.Then,eDNA was detected in the water samples in aquarium tanks with different numbers of P.rabaudi,The target DNA concentration and the number of P.rabaudi had a positive correlation of R~2 was 0.957,and the correlation curve between DNA concentration and the individual number was obtained:y = 131 546x + 77 623.In addition,after the removal of P.rabaudi,the copies of eDNA were negatively correlated with time,and its retention time in the water environment was about 17 days.In this study,we found that the DNA primer and Taqman probe could be applied to the qualitative detection of P.rabaudi in water with high specificity,as well as estimate fish density in tanks quantitatively.These results demonstrate that eDNA analysis method is a potential tool to reflect the biomass of P.rabaudi in different sampling sites,which can provide a basis for assessment of artificial release effect and resource management of P.rabaudi in the future.",academic,,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,,CSCD:7224425,,,,,,Detection and

order to establish a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for the detection of P.rabaudi and distinguish it from other fishes in the Yangtze River,this study designed eDNA primers and a TaqMan

We aimed to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) loss due to dental conditions in the US adult population. Social inequalities in QALE loss by dental conditions were also examined. Data from 3 cross-sectional waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES waves 2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, and 2011 to 2012) were pooled and analyzed. The average age of study participants (n = 9,445) was 48.4 y. Disutility scores were derived from self-rated health and the numbers of physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, and days with activity limitation, employing a previously published algorithm. The associations between the disutility scores and the numbers of decayed teeth, missing teeth, and periodontitis were examined by multiple linear regression stratified by age groups (20-39, 40-59, and >= 60 y), adjusted for other covariates (age, sex, wave fixed effect, educational attainment, smoking, and diabetes).

However, the studies on the effects on soil-property dynamics after land-use changes are limited in semiarid regions. In this context, an experimental area with a semiarid climate allowed the assessment and comparison of physicochemical soil properties (soil organic C [SOC], soil total N [TN], available P [AP], available K [AK], cation-exchange capacity [CEC], bulk density [BD], pH, available water-holding capacity [AWHC], and C:N ratio) after Pinus halepensis afforestation and secondary succession following agriculture abandonment in 1994. The impact of 12 soil-preparation treatments for planting on soil properties was also evaluated. For this, soil samples (0-10 cm deep) from the afforestation were taken in 1998, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016, and from abandoned cropland in 2010, 2013, and 2016. In afforestation, soil-preparation treatments did not alter differentially the soil properties after 22 years. Significant differences among years were found in SOC, TN, AP, AK, CEC, pH, and C:N. BD changes were detected neither in afforestation nor in abandoned cropland. After 22 years, only SOC, AK and the C:N ratio proved significantly higher in afforestation than in abandoned cropland. In general, soil properties improvement (i.e. SOC, TN, AP, AK, and CEC) was slow after afforestation and abandoned cropland likely due to the legacy of the previous land use (cereal crops) and the semiarid climate influence.

The highest biogas production of 450 mL/g-VS was obtained at 4 g-hydrochar/L addition. The methane content was also increased from 57.5% to up to 69.8%. Each gram of hydrochar removed 25 mg of ammonium and 50 mg of VFA. Hydrochar addition promoted the conversion of VFA to biogas by strengthening the intensity of functional groups and the immobilization of microbial biomass. Co-digestion of SP with RS or HRS also increased the biogas production, and the optimal production of 428 mL/g VS was obtained at 70% SP and 30% RS. The co-digestion of carcass SP with RS and the addition of hydrochar can be a promising solution for improving biogas production from a pig carcass, and can be potentially developed as a sustainable waste management method.

However, it is known that the fungal biomass contains various biopolymers among which is chitin -the precursor of chitosan. In the present work, fungal biomass was used as raw material for the extraction of a biopolymer containing chitosan by the acid/alkaline method. Different extraction conditions were assayed: the concentration of alkali, time, and temperature of treatments. The biopolymer was characterized and applied in the synthesis of nickel ferrite by the coprecipitation method demonstrating the possibility of obtaining a nanostructured magnetic system coated with fungal chitosan in a single step. The properties of the obtained nanostructured magnetic material were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometrv. and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.

The Czech Republic has recently become Europe's epicenter of the outbreak of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus, the most aggressive species in Eurasia. We investigated a countrywide outbreak dynamic during the period 2003-2019, with a special focus on the period 2017-2019 when the outbreak reached an unprecedented intensity. In order to identify main outbreak drivers, we investigated annual time series of the volume of trees killed by bark beetles in the Czech districts (n = 77), and a suite of climatic and forest structure related predictors using Generalized Additive Models. Finally, we reviewed a large body of public materials to understand broader social, ecological, and economic implications of the outbreak. We found that bark beetles were damaging 0.2-1.4% of Norway spruce growing stock annually across the Czech Republic in the period 2003-2016. This level increased to 3.1-5.4% in 2017-2019, causing the total depletion of spruce in some regions. The long-term bark beetle dynamics (2003-2019) was driven by the combination of wind disturbance and climatic drivers, represented in our study by annual temperature anomaly and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. However, the effect of wind was diminished during the period 2017-2019, whereas the effect of drought dominated. Our findings thus suggest a transition from wind-to drought-driven bark beetle dynamics. The outbreak and subsequent large-scale salvaging and wood transportation affected quality of life of people in a broad vicinity of outbreak areas. Extensive management actions aggravated some of the notorious conflicts between forest management and nature conservation, and highlighted the poor harmonization of respective policies. A decrease in timber price, an excessive workload, and other cascading effects caused severe revenue loss, requiring state interventions amounting to ca 260 million EUR in 2018-2019.

Meanwhile, a few studies have shown that self-compassion is rooted in early experiences with parents. However, it is unclear whether interactions with partners and children affect adults' self-compassion, and the role of their self-compassion in interactions with significant others. This study examined bidirectional longitudinal relationships between Chinese parents' marital satisfaction, parenting stress, and self-compassion following a three-wave longitudinal design. A sample of 322 Chinese father-mother dyads (father's M-age = 35.84, SDage = 5.76; mother's M-age = 34.32, SDage = 5.46) completed a set of questionnaires at three time points. The results showed that marital satisfaction positively predicted the fathers' and mothers' self-compassion, while parenting stress did not significantly predict the parents' self-compassion; In contrast, parents' self-compassion did not significantly predict marital satisfaction or parenting stress. Additionally, there was a bidirectional relationship between marital satisfaction and parenting stress in fathers and mothers. Finally, mothers' marital satisfaction positively mediated the relationship between parenting stress and self-compassion/next-stage parenting stress. This study revealed that adults' self-compassion can develop from caring and supportive relationships, including marital relationships. Highlighting key mechanisms of marital satisfaction, such as increasing self-compassion and reducing parenting stress, may contribute to the improvement of adults' mental health."

Here, we benchmark the potential national availability of grassland biomass, identify optimal strategies for its management, and investigate the relative importance of intensification over reversion (prioritising productivity versus environmental ecosystemservices). Process-conservativemeta-models for different grasslands were used to calculate the baseline drymatter yields (DMY; 1961-1990) at 1 km(2) resolution for the whole UK. The effects of climate change, rising atmospheric [CO2] and technological progress on baseline DMYs were used to estimate future grassland productivities (up to 2050) for low and medium CO2 emission scenarios of UKCP09. UK benchmark productivities of 12.5, 8.7 and 2.8 t/ha on temporary, permanent and rough-grazing grassland, respectively, accounted for productivity gains by 2010. By 2050, productivities under medium emission scenario are predicted to increase to 15.5 and 9.8 t/ha on temporary and permanent grassland, respectively, but not on rough grassland. Based on surveyed grassland distributions for Great Britain in 2010 the annual availability of grassland biomass is likely to rise from 64 to 72 million tonnes by 2050. Assuming optimal N application could close existing productivity gaps of ca. 40% a range of management options could deliver additional 21 * 10(6) tonnes of biomass available for bioenergy. Scenarios of changes in grassland use intensity demonstrated considerable scope for maintaining or further increasing grassland production and sparing some grassland for the provision of environmental ecosystem services.

The brain-gut axis plays an important role in the pathophysiological changes involved in IBS; however, an effective treatment for the same is lacking. The natural compound costunolide (COS) has been shown to exert gastroprotective, enteroprotective, and neuroprotective effects, but its therapeutic effects in IBS are unclear. Our study explored the effect of COS on intestinal dysfunction and depressive behaviour in stress-induced IBS mice. Mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress to trigger IBS, and some were administered COS. Behavioural tests, histochemical assays, western blotting, and measurement of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the colon and hippocampus were applied to monitor the physiological and molecular consequences of COS treatment in IBS mice. COS administration relieved intestinal dysfunction and depression-like behaviours in IBS mice. Improvements in low-grade colon inflammation and intestinal mucosal permeability, inhibition of the activation of mast cells, upregulation of colonic Occludin expression, and downregulation of Claudin 2 expression were also observed.

The results highlight that the hardware of the nGfHA has secondary effects on the environmental impacts of the complete nGfHA configuration; the highest contribution to the environmental impact comes from the Li-ion energy storage, followed by PV, use phase and nGfHA hardware. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis shows that an extended lifetime of energy storage leads to equivalent environmental performances."

Land use practices, such as planting previously cropped lands into perennial grasslands, can increase soil C sequestration; however, the temporal response of soil C pools to such changes in land use are likely complex and not well quantified. In the current study, a space-fortime approach was used to assess the response of soil C sequestration and microbial community composition during a five-year grazed pasture rotation following three years of vegetable production on a central Kentucky farm. After 5 years in pasture, soil organic C and N in the top 15 cm increased 20.6% and 20.1%, respectively, from year 1 levels, and particulate organic matter C (POM C) increased 53.5%. A carbon mineralization (CM) assay indicated that the potential release of CO2 also increased with time in pasture rotation. When compared to permanent pasture (not previously used for vegetable production), soil microbial community composition differed in rotation years 1-3 but became similar in years 4 and 5. Multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis showed that CM and POM were key factors affecting microbial community composition.

The principal objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological morbidity experienced by arthroplasty surgeons during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives included characterizing influential variables affecting the surgeon's well-being and suggesting directives for improvement. Methods: This study surveyed Canadian Arthroplasty Society (CAS) members regarding their psychological well-being using the validated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult (PWI-A). As well, the survey included questions regarding concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures, personal wellbeing, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: A total of 80 surgeons (52% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire, representing all 10 provinces in Canada. The prevalence of emotional distress and depression were 38% and 29%, respectively. Psychological morbidity most commonly resulted from concerns of loss of income/operating time, experiences of emotional conflict, and generalized safety worries.

The principal objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological morbidity experienced by arthroplasty surgeons during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives included characterizing influential variables affecting the surgeon's well-being and suggesting directives for improvement. Methods: This study surveyed Canadian Arthroplasty Society (CAS) members regarding their psychological well-being using the validated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult (PWI-A). As well, the survey included questions regarding concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures, personal wellbeing, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: A total of 80 surgeons (52% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire, representing all 10 provinces in Canada. The prevalence of emotional distress and depression were 38% and 29%, respectively. Psychological morbidity most commonly resulted from concerns of loss of income/operating time, experiences of emotional conflict, and generalized safety worries.

Although reduced graphene oxide/titanium dioxide (rGO/TiO2) nanocomposite is a potential candidate for wastewater treatment, the influence of graphene oxide (GO) content on its physico-chemical characteristics and its subsequent photocatalytic capabilities in degrading the organic contaminants has not been well established. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to assess the use of rGO/TiO2 nanocomposites with various GO contents for the removal of toxic methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution. Method: In the present study, rGO/TiO2 nanocomposites were fabricated using various GO contents through a one-step solvothermal method. The effect of GO content on the nanocomposite formation was investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy.

Results: Based on the photocatalytic results, the highest removal percentage of MB was achieved by 0.15rGO/TiO2, which was about 1.7 times higher than that of 0.01rGO/TiO2. Conclusion: The enhanced removal efficiency of MB by the nanocomposite with the highest GO content (0.15 g) was attributed to the increased active adsorption sites, which greatly promoted pi-pi the interaction between the aromatic rings of MB dye and the graphitic skeleton of rGO, as well as the electrostatic interaction between the cationic center of MB molecules and the residual oxygen functionalities of rGO.', 'AF': ['Siong, Valerie Ling Er', 'Lai, Chin Wei', 'Juan, Joon Ching', 'Lee, Kian Mun', 'Leo, Bey Fen', 'Khe, Cheng Seong'], 'AU': ['Siong, VLE', 'Lai, CW', 'Juan, JC', 'Lee, KM', 'Leo, BF', 'Khe, CS'], 'BP': '157', 'DI': '10.2174/1573413714666180426092927', 'EI': '1875-6786', 'EP': '162', 'IS': '2', 'OI': ['Juan, Joon Ching/0000-0002-8253-6049', 'Leo, Bey Fen/0000-0002-8075-0295'], 'PT': 'J', 'PY': '2019', 'RI': ['Leo, Bey Fen/AAA-1455-2020', 'Lai, Chin Wei/E-7062-2013', 'Seong, Khe/AAA-1302-2020', 'Mun, Lee/J-9832-2016', 'Juan, Joon Ching/G-8364-2014', 'Leo, Bey Fen/C-4133-2017'], 'SN': '1573-4137', 'SO': 'CURRENT NANOSCIENCE', 'TI': 'One-Step Solvothermal Synthesis of rGO/TiO<sub>2</sub> Nano-composite for Efficient Solar Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue Dye', 'UT': 'WOS:000459042800005', 'VL': '15'}}",3798656b-31b3-4f62-85cb-13b0302bd9b0,1.0,0.0,sirui.zhu,"Background: The discharge of effluents from the textile and dyeing industries has been a worldwide concern. Although reduced graphene oxide/titanium dioxide (rGO/TiO2) nanocomposite is a potential candidate for wastewater treatment, the influence of graphene oxide (GO) content on its physico-chemical characteristics and its subsequent photocatalytic capabilities in degrading the organic contaminants has not been well established. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to assess the use of rGO/TiO2 nanocomposites with various GO contents for the removal of toxic methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution. Method: In the present study, rGO/TiO2 nanocomposites were fabricated using various GO contents through a one-step solvothermal method. The effect of GO content on the nanocomposite formation was investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy.

In each of the model set-ups, we applied the same changes in the magnitude of mortality ( +/- 20%) of the highest trophic zooplankton level (Z1). Model results showed overall dampened responses of phytoplankton relative to Z1 biomass. Phytoplankton responses varied depending on the food web structure and trophic coupling represented in the models. Hence, a priori model assumptions were found to influence cascades and pathways in model estimates and, thus, become highly relevant when examining ecosystem pressures such as fishing and climate change. Especially, the different roles and parameterizations of additional zooplankton groups grazed by Z1, and their importance for the outcome, emphasized the need for better calibration data.

This challenge becomes even more pressing for resource-constrained farmers residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), who disproportionately bear the brunt of food insecurity. In response to this critical issue, the Predictive Optimal Water and Energy Irrigation (POWEIr) controller is a promising solution. The POWEIr controller was designed as an affordable precision irrigation controller for solar-powered drip irrigation (SPDI) systems and offers an avenue to widen access to SPDI and precision agriculture for low-income farmers. The POWEIr controller creates energy- and water-efficient irrigation schedules that aim to reduce overall system costs. Employing simple yet effective physics-based models alongside minimal sensors to maintain cost-effectiveness, the controller's accuracy has, until now, remained unexplored. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the POWEIr controller's optimized irrigation schedules to user and weather sensor accuracy errors in inputs, while also assessing their impact on simulated crop yields. The results reveal that, under the tested scenarios, opting for a low-cost weather station over a high-quality counterpart could potentially save farmers over $900 with negligible consequences to crop yields. This conclusion held steadfast across diverse crop and soil types. The most significant factor affecting the optimal irrigation schedule was found to be changes in the crop coefficient, pointing to the need for calibration of the controller. This research underscores the POWEIr controller's capability to optimize irrigation schedules through the use of cost-effective sensors and minimal calibration efforts. In doing so, it opens the door to greater adoption of precision irrigation technology and sustainable irrigation practices among farmers in LMICs. Ultimately, this progress has the potential to catalyze sustainable agriculture intensification on a global scale, moving us closer to a more food-secure and environmentally responsible future."

Batch experiments were defined using the statistical method of the Design of Experiments (DoE) in order to evaluate the effect of each compound and their interaction on PAA decay. Results showed that the organics consumed immediately a considerable amount of PAA, independently from the initial PAA concentration, and consumption dropped rapidly to almost nil after 5 min, whereas PAA consumption due to the inorganics was slow, dependent on the initial PAA concentration and persisted until the end of the experiments (60 min). In detail, inorganics (such as reduced iron and orthophosphate) have shown to be the main drivers of the exponential decay: iron, particularly, has proved to directly consume PAA due to its catalysing capacity, whereas orthophosphate has shown to mainly interact with iron, acting as a chelating compound towards iron and consequently reducing the iron effect in consuming PAA. As for organics, proteins such as, casein and peptone, have been highlighted as the main cause of the initial PAA demand, probably due to the homolytic fission of PAA to generate peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, which are known to have a high reactivity towards proteins.

In this study we explore the use of an unstructured-mesh finite-volume modelling approach to assist in filling the knowledge gaps with respect to coastal circulation in remote island locations-selecting the Vanuatu and New Caledonia archipelagos as our example study site. Past limited observations and modelling studies are leveraged to construct and verify a regional/coastal ocean model based on the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). Following verification with respect to tidal behaviour, we investigate how changes in wind speed and direction, and SLR, alter coastal water levels and coastal currents. Results showed tidal residual circulation was typically associated with flow separation at headlands and islands. Trade winds had negligible effect on water levels at the coast, however, wind-residual circulation was sensitive to both wind speed and direction. Wind-residual currents were typically strongest close to coastlines. Wind residual circulation patterns were strongly influenced by Ekman flow, while island blocking, topographic steering and geostrophic currents also appear to influence current patterns. Tidal amplitudes and phases were unchanged due to SLR of up to 2 m, while maximum current speeds altered by as much as 20 cm/s within some coastal embayments. Non-linear relationships between SLR and maximum current speeds were seen at some coastal reef platform sites. Under higher sea levels, tidal residual currents altered by less than +/- 2 cm/s which is relatively significant given maximum tidal residual current speeds are typically below 10 cm/s. Our findings indicate that under higher sea levels, coastal processes governing sediment transport, pollutant dispersal and larval transport are likely to alter, which may have implications for coastal environments and ecosystems.

The pyrolysis conditions included the pyrolysis temperature (300-700 degrees C), retention time (15-90 min), heating rate (1-10 degrees C min(-1)), gas flow rate (20-200 mL min(-1)) and feedstock particle size (<0.075, 0.075 0.150, 0.150-0.300 and 0.300-2.00 mm). Various analytical techniques were used to characterize the biochar for ultimate and proximate analyses, higher heating value (23.99-30.44 MJ kg(-1)), pH (8.11 -12.89), electrical conductivity (22.78-34.44 mS cm(-1)), surface functional groups (acidic, carboxylic and basic groups), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, pore volume (0.055-1.241 cm(3) g(-1)) and specific surface area (7.12-20.96 m(2) g(-1)). The results demonstrated that the temperature predominantly regulated the product yields distribution and characteristics of produced biochar. Furthermore, the heating rate considerably influenced the biochar proximate composition, micropore surface area and pore size. Particle size had significant influences on biochar surface porosity and bio-oil yield.

The strain Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC 20509 produced the highest total dry weight (TDW) amount (22.4 g/L), that contained 3.4 g/L of intra-cellular lipids, followed by C. curvatus NRRL Y-1511, which produced 20.6 g/L of TDW and 3.2 g/L lipids. A novel, non-previously systematically studied strain, namely Papiliotrema laurentii NRRL Y-2536, produced significant quantities of TDW (22.0 g/L) and, interestingly, secreted quantities of exopolysaccharides. Fed-batch shake-flask cultivation of C. curvatus ATCC 20509 in pretreated second cheese whey, pulse-supplemented with condensed cheese whey-derived lactose, led to the significant TDW quantity of 38.1 g/L that contained c. 57% w/w of total lipids (lipids at a concentration 21.7 g/L were produced). Cellular lipids of all microorganisms, mainly stored as triacylglycerols, contained in variable quantities the fatty acids (Delta 9)C18:1, C16:0, (Delta 9,12)C18:2 and C18:0, constituting perfect candidates for the synthesis of ""second generation"" biodiesel."

This study aimed to better understand the consequences of land-use change by focusing on long-term effects on both soil biotic and abiotic parameters. For this purpose, we selected three productive farms under similar management, each of them with pristine forest sites and agricultural sites that had been deforested for similar to 15 and similar to 30 years. In each site, we analysed soil microbiological (phospholipid fatty acids [PLFAs], biomass and activity) and physicochemical parameters. Long-term land-use change caused a detriment in soil microbial biomass, activity and fungal abundance, but only small changes in PLFA composition. In fact, PLFA composition was more affected by soil physicochemical properties such as carbon-to-nutrient ratios and labile carbon than by land use. Some physicochemical parameters (e.g., organic carbon and nutrients) were also negatively affected by land-use change and were more sensitive to time under agricultural use than microbiological parameters. The lower sensitivity of microbiological parameters could be the result of severe drought conditions at sampling, which may have affected soil microbial communities in both land uses. We were also able to detect associations between specific microbiological and physicochemical parameters.

This study investigates the impact of herbicide atrazine (ATZ) on the overall performance, EPS yield, composition, and sludge morphology in an activated sludge (AS) system operated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Since conventional methods for analyzing EPS are time-consuming and releases residues, a new approach was developed in this work to evaluate the EPS fractions and components, based on the morphological characterization of the biomass using quantitative image analysis (QIA) technique coupled with multivariate statistics. Results showed that exposure to ATZ inhibit biomass activity in terms of organic matter (COD) and nitrogen removal. Moreover, both tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) increased under ATZ, indicating that microorganisms release EPS as a defense mechanism against environmental changes. The PN/PS ratio also increases, indicating likely increased hydrophobicity in ATZ phases. Furthermore, ATZ phases exhibit a predominance of large aggregates compared to intermediate and small ones, indicating a change in aggregate morphological structure associated with EPS production. The new approach using QIA coupled with partial least squares (PLS) modeling provides accurate predictions of EPS content. The increase in TB-EPS is closely related to the rise of large aggregates in phases exposed to higher ATZ concentrations. The PLS models demonstrate high accuracy for EPS prediction (coefficients of determination, R-2 above 0.86), showcasing the feasibility of using QIA for EPS assessment in AS systems.

However, the impact of subsurface snow algae (e.g., when cells are covered by recent snowfall) on albedo is unknown. Here, we examined the impact of subsurface snow algae on surface energy absorption by adding up to 2 cm of clean snow to surface algal blooms and measuring reflectivity. Surprisingly, snow algae still absorb significant energy across an array of wavelengths when snow-covered. Furthermore, the scale of this effect correlates with algal cell densities and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Collectively, our results suggest that darkening by subsurface snow algae lowers albedo and thus potentially accelerates snowmelt even when the algae is snow-covered. Impacts of subsurface algae on melt await assessment. This implies that snow algae play a larger role in cryosphere melt than investigations of surface-only reflectance would suggest. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a gap in research by examining the impact of subsurface snow algae on snow albedo, which affects snowmelt rates. Previous studies have focused on visible surface blooms, leaving the effects of hidden algae unquantified. Our findings reveal that snow algae beneath the surface can still absorb energy across various wavelengths, accelerating melt even when not visible to the naked eye. This suggests that spectral remote sensing can detect these hidden algae, although their biomass might be underestimated.

However, its contribution to decreases in greenhouse gases (GHG) is not an absolute guarantee. In this context, it is necessary to evaluate its benefits in advance, considering the structure of the electric energy supply matrix of the country producing the photovoltaic solar system, as well as the country where the technology will be implemented. This study evaluates the adoption of renewable sources for electric power generation in a country with a high share of renewable energy. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a set of multi-Si photovoltaic (PV) systems installed in the Brazilian northeast (NE), was carried out. The actual generation data of 10 plants totaling 1.1 MWp installed capacity were evaluated during two years of operation. Energy payback time (EPBT), greenhouse gas emission rate (GHGe-rate), and emission payback time were calculated.

Previous studies have emphasised the multiple benefits of riparian buffer strips such as nutrient filtration and sediment trapping, which can be transported in overland flow and implies runoff is attenuated. Riparian buffer strips are not explicitly considered a natural flood management (NFM) measure. Nonetheless, they have the potential for inclusion to the catalogue of nature-based measures being implemented to reduce runoff and flood risk, while offering multiple benefits. An ecosystem services (ES) approach can be adopted to assess NFM multiple benefits (as multiple ES) and this study utilises a subset of ES to provide an example of this. Regulating and supporting ES were utilised to determine the effectiveness of riparian buffer strips as an NFM measure. At field scale, an experimental approach assessed flood regulation by monitoring runoff attenuation in a riparian buffer strip situated on an agricultural hillslope. An indication of nutrient cycling and primary production conditions at field scale was achieved by monitoring algae biomass and comparing a buffered and non-buffered site. The interaction between precipitation events, land management changes and nutrient concentrations were considered at the buffered site in relation to runoff attenuation and algae biomass response. At catchment scale, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was utilised to explore reduction in peak flow (flood regulation) in response to varying scenarios of catchment-wide riparian buffer strips in terms of width and vegetation type. The empirical field observations demonstrated the riparian buffer strip provided runoff attenuation. Higher volumes of runoff coincided with bare soils in the adjacent field, wetter antecedent conditions, higher precipitation depths and intense precipitation. However, runoff attenuation could be improved. On the hillslope, microtopography of vehicle tracks diverted overland flow away from the buffer but the field corner demonstrated potential for a complimentary runoff attenuation feature (e.g. a temporary storage pond). At catchment scale, the 10 m grass-based buffer strip was concluded to be most effective for flood regulation and achieve a greater ratio of peak flow reduction (average 7.2%) to area of land required (2.1% of catchment). The riparian buffer strip demonstrated marginally better ecological quality conditions for nutrient cycling and primary production compared to the non-buffered site. Buffer shading positively affected the supporting ES. The study suggested high flows as a likely dominant influence on algae biomass. Overall, riparian buffer strips were concluded to be an effective NFM measure at field and catchment scale but could be improved with complimentary measures when located on a hillslope."

In order to study the long-term interaction between soil erosion and vegetation change, a comprehensive modeling framework was proposed by combining the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The Huangfuchuan Watershed was taken as an example area due to serious erosion and large-scale conversion of farmland to forest. Based on long-term variation analyses from 1956 to 2020, the effect of land cover change on runoff and sediment discharge was quantified using SWAT to create scenario simulations, and then environmental stresses factors (i.e., soil water content, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents) output by SWAT were input into EPIC to evaluate effects of soil erosion on potential biomass of vegetation. Results showed that the annual runoff reduction was 32.5 million m3 and the annual sediment reduction was 15 million t during the past 65 years. The scenario we created using the SWAT simulation showed that both forest and grassland reduced water yield, while bare land increased water yield by 10%. In addition, grassland and forest reduced soil erosion by 20% and 18%, respectively, while bare land increased sand production by 210%. The EPIC model results exhibited a negative correlation between the potential for vegetation biomass and erosion intensity. The average annual potential biomass of forest and grass under micro-erosion was 585.7 kg/ha and 485.9 kg/ha, respectively, and was 297.9 kg/ha and 154.6 kg/ha, respectively, under the extremely strong erosion.

In addition, grassland and forest reduced soil erosion by 20% and 18%, respectively, while bare land increased sand production by 210%. The EPIC model results exhibited a negative correlation between the potential for vegetation biomass and erosion intensity. The average annual potential biomass of forest and grass under micro-erosion was 585.7 kg/ha and 485.9 kg/ha, respectively, and was 297.9 kg/ha and 154.6 kg/ha, respectively, under the extremely strong erosion.

In order to study the long-term interaction between soil erosion and vegetation change, a comprehensive modeling framework was proposed by combining the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The Huangfuchuan Watershed was taken as an example area due to serious erosion and large-scale conversion of farmland to forest. Based on long-term variation analyses from 1956 to 2020, the effect of land cover change on runoff and sediment discharge was quantified using SWAT to create scenario simulations, and then environmental stresses factors (i.e., soil water content, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents) output by SWAT were input into EPIC to evaluate effects of soil erosion on potential biomass of vegetation. Results showed that the annual runoff reduction was 32.5 million m3 and the annual sediment reduction was 15 million t during the past 65 years.

In this context, wastewater treatment (WWT) facilities are of vital significance for urban systems. Wastewater management clearly plays a central role in achieving future water security in a world where water stress is expected to increase. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be used as a tool to evaluate the environmental impacts associated to WWTPs and improvement options. In this study, LCA is applied to compare the environmental performance of different scenarios for wastewater and sludge disposal in a WWT plant located in Southern Italy. The first scenario (BAU, Business As Usual) is based on the present sludge management performed within and outside the case-study plant: after mechanical treatment, dewatered sludge is transported by truck to a landfill for final disposal, while treated water is released to a river. The second scenario (B) assumes a partially circular pattern, with anaerobic fermentation of sludge to biogas, biogas use for electricity and heat cogeneration, integrated by additional thermal energy from previously recovered waste cooking oil (WCO), electricity and heat feedback to upstream WWT steps (including sludge drying), and final disposal of dried sludge to landfill and water to river. The third scenario (C) suggests an improved circular pattern with gasification of the dried sludge to further support heat and electricity production (with very small delivery of residues to landfill). The fourth scenario (D) builds on the third scenario in that the volume of treated wastewater is not discharged into local rivers but is partially used for fertirrigation of Salix Alba fields, whose biomass is further used for electricity generation. In doing so, the water P and N content decreases and so does the water eutrophication potential. Finally, a renewable scenario (E) is built assuming that the electricity demand of the WWT plant is met by a green electricity mix, for comparison with previous options. The most impacted categories in all scenarios result to be Freshwater Eutrophication Potential (FEP) and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). Increased circularity through recycling in scenarios B and C reduces the process contribution to some environmental impact categories such as Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Fossil Depletion Potential (FDP), but does not provide significant improvement to FEP. Fertirrigation in scenario D lowers FEP by about 60% compared to the BAU scenario. Furthermore, HTP is lowered by almost 53%. Finally, other options are discussed that could be also explored in future studies to evaluate if and to what extent they could further improve the overall performance of the WWT plant.

Results showed that hydrothermal carbonization temperature 180 & DEG;C is more suitable for producing solid fuel in terms of low heavy metals content. Higher hydrothermal carbonization temperature (240 & DEG;C) decreased O/C content and improved various characteristics of the hydrochar such as coalification degree, carbon content, higher heating value and the specific surface area. While hydrothermal carbonization conducted at lower temperature of 180 & DEG;C, was advantageous for obtaining higher energy yield efficiency and hydrochar yield. The gasification reactivity of hydrochar was more sensitive to the heating rate than the pyrolysis process. The activation energy (E-a) of the pyrolysis process varied significantly with conversion, whereas the gasification activation energy changes were insignificant. Based on the reactivity prediction, the hydrothermal carbonization effect on corn straw and rice husk was almost similar. The hydrochar generated under severe hydrothermal carbonization temperature (240 & DEG;C) showed higher thermal stability during pyrolysis in comparison with gasification. Compared with the gasification of rice husk hydrochar, hydrochar gasification of corn straw had lower E-a, hence requires less energy to produce syngas. The results of this research imply that biomass hydrochar is a suitable alternative option to produce pulverized solid fuel."

In the transport sector, this tension is observed between biofuels that still rely on national policies and gasoline/diesel subsidies. Using a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, we study how phasing out gasoline and diesel subsidies would impact global biofuel mandates. We find that where they are implemented, Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reforms increase biofuel competitiveness and lower the cost of achieving the mandates. The fiscal benefit is therefore twofold with savings on fossil and bio-based energy subsidies. In a multilateral reform scenario, we simulate the rise in fiscal revenue from phasing out the fossil fuel subsidies to be 25% higher when the avoided spending on biofuels' support is accounted for.

The Tisler reef is a marine protected area located under a ferry ""highway"" that connects Norway and Sweden. Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as being important hotspots of both biodiversity and biomass, they function as breeding and nursing grounds for commercially important fish and are essential in providing ecosystem functions. Whilst studies have shown that fishery, ocean warming, and acidification threaten them, the effects of noise pollution on cold-water coral reefs remains unstudied.

For this to happen, all sectors must be included in the effort to decarbonize. Two major sources of anthropogenic emissions are the electricity and industrial sectors, combined accounting for 49% of 2018 U.S. anthropogenic GHG emission. This dissertation addresses challenges with decarbonization in the electricity sector and outlines potential decarbonization pathways in the U.S. steel sector. The steel industry accounts for 25% of industrial sector CO2 emissions globaly. This dissertation addresses two electricity sector challenges, which stem from the inherent variability and uncertainty of wind and solar generation, which we specify as variable renewable energy (VRE). The first is the need for sustainable frequency regulation resources, which increase with the addition of VRE. Energy storage, specifically lithium ion batteries, are an attractive option. However, their systems environmental impacts were unknown. In order to quantify potential environmental impacts Chapter 2 employs a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework, which couples cradle-to-gate and end-of-life LCA data on lithium ion batteries with a unit commitment and dispatch model run on a 9-bus power system with lithium ion batteries used for frequency regulation. Chapter 2 finds that the sustainability of lithium ion batteries in this application depends on the grid mix and that the constant charging and discharging required for frequency regulation does not increase the upstream and end-of-life impacts beyond the use-phase. The second challenge with the addition of VRE this dissertation addresses is the need to improve day-ahead generator scheduling to prevent unplanned startups and shutdowns (i.e., commitment error) caused by the increased variability in net load. Chapter 3 uses a regression model to quantify the relationship between net load shape, VRE generation, and commitment error with the goal of predicting commitment error in order to improve the day-ahead schedules and reduce system inefficiency. Chapter 3 finds statistically significant relationships between net load, ramp rate, portion VRE generation, and commitment error. Using these relationships, the regression models were able to explain 21-57% of the variability in commitment error. This dissertation also analyzes options for U.S. steel sector decarbonization. Steel use spans almost all sectors and its use is correlated to economic growth. However, its production is carbon intensive. Through examination of available and developing production technologies in combination with steel flow modeling Chapter 4 outlines potential pathways for U.S. to cut emissions allocated to its steel consumption 70% by 2050 from 2010 levels. There are a number of steps the U.S. steel sector could take to reduce CO2 emissions, however, Chapter 4’s results indicate that, given available technologies, steel stocks per capita, in turn demand, must be reduced in the near term to have a chance of cutting CO2 emissions 70%. The challenges in decarbonizing the electricity sector are focused on supply side measures, while this dissertation recommends demand side changes for the steel sector. This is a result of the stark difference in availability of low carbon technologies. Although there remain outstanding challenges with electricity decarbonization they are technological or market based both being easier to address than the demand changes required in the steel sector, which will likely require top down regulation and incentives to achieve.

This study investigated the changes in emotional distress among residents in Hubei, the epicenter of the pandemic in China during the early stage of the pandemic, and we examined the sociodemographic differences in their emotional recovery. Methods: We undertook a two-wave panel survey of 3816 residents aged >= 18 in Hubei, China. The baseline survey was conducted during early February 2020, the peak of the outbreak. The follow-up survey was carried out when the pandemic was mainly under control. The data enabled us to investigate the within-person changes in COVID-19-related negative emotions. Mixed-effect regression models with a random effect for participants were used to accommodate repeated measures. Results: Respondents reported high levels of emotional distress at the peak of the pandemic and experienced a decline in emotional distress when the pandemic was under control.

Despite the low demand caused by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, an increase in the services offered by the sector is expected again. In an economic context still dependent on scarce oil, this represents a problem. There is also a problem arising from the fuel's environmental impact throughout its life cycle. Given this, a promising solution is the use of biojet fuel as renewable aviation fuel. In a circular economy framework, the use of lignocellulosic biomass in the form of sugar-rich crop residues allows the production of alcohols necessary to obtain biojet fuel. The tools provided by process intensification also make it possible to design a sustainable process with low environmental impact and capable of achieving energy savings. The goal of this work was to design an intensified process to produce biojet fuel from Mexican lignocellulosic biomass, with alcohols as intermediates. The process was modeled following a sequence of pretreatment/hydrolysis/fermentation/purification for the biomass-ethanol process, and dehydration/oligomerization/hydrogenation/distillation for ethanol-biojet process under the concept of distributed configuration. To obtain a cleaner, greener, and cheaper process, the purification zone of ethanol was intensified by employing a vapor side stream distillation column and a dividing wall column. Once designed, the entire process was optimized by employing the stochastic method of differential evolution with a tabu list to minimize the total annual cost and with the Eco-indicator-99 to evaluate the sustainability of the process.

Changes in incident waves can alter cross-shore sediment exchange and, thus, affect the sediment budget and morphology of atoll reef islands. Here we investigate the influence of sea level rise and projected wave climate change on wave characteristics and cross-shore sediment transport across an atoll reef at Kwajalein Island, Republic of the Marshall Islands. Using a phase-resolving model, we quantify the influence on sediment transport of quantities not well captured by wave-averaged models, namely, wave asymmetry and skewness and flow acceleration. Model results suggest that for current reef geometry, sea level, and wave climate, potential bedload transport is directed onshore, decreases from the fore reef to the beach, and is sensitive to the influence of flow acceleration. We find that a projected 12% decrease in annual wave energy by 2100 CE has negligible influence on reef flat hydrodynamics. However, 0.5-2.0 m of sea level rise increases wave heights, skewness, and shear stress on the reef flat and decreases wave skewness and shear stress on the fore reef.

By augmenting the model with a DEM-based HC index, we investigate hydrological behaviors following the construction of a USF in China's Loess Hilly Region. Nine scenarios are designed, to explore the effects of co-evolving ecohydrology and landscape on soil erosion and HC in USFs deployed in different climates and terrains, by altering the annual precipitation, rainfall frequency, and ground slope. Our results show that the USF considerably increased runoff (99.18%-154.26%) during its operational period, and soil erosion rate (21.4%-74.84% and 25.35%-76.18%) and HC (0.08%-0.26% and 0.47%-0.91%) throughout construction and operational periods, respectively.

Governments are implementing large scales of public policies, regulations, incentives, and disincentives to build more infrastructure to promote vehicle electrification. However, the equity impacts of these policies, especially the non-financial, planning-related policies, are rarely discussed and evaluated in existing academic literature and professional reports. This dissertation aims to explore different quantitative methods to evaluate the equity impact of EV policies. The dissertation is based comprised of three parts: (1) the theoretical and philosophical contexts of equity and justice in planning, transportation, and vehicular electrification, and a discussion of existing EV policies around the world; (2) three sets of research that evaluate the equity impact of EV policies from different angles; and (3) the conclusions. The first study is to explore how different socioeconomic groups weigh the importance of three non-financial incentives, namely charging infrastructure, free parking, and HOV lane access, and how they influence the EV purchase decision-making in California. An Ordered Logistic Regression and its time-modifying effects between 2017 and 2019 were applied with the data, the California Vehicle Survey from California Energy Commission. Both logistic regression model and the time-varying model suggest that the EV buyers from the marginalized group, including the low-income and non-single family homeowner groups, consider public charging availability the most crucial incentive to their EV purchase, while the more advantaged drivers find HOV lane access to be the most critical. The second study aims to estimate the carbon reduction amount of each driver, and to forecast the carbon mitigation cost, as well as the transition cost to EV by socioeconomic groups under the scenario of a full transition to EV. We create the two scenarios using the assumptions that consumers switch to EV immediately with a new Tesla Model 3 and a used Chevrolet Bolt. Multiple regression tree and boosted regression tree algorithms were applied. The 2019 California Vehicle Survey is used as the database to provide existing driving behavior as input to the forecasting model. The result finds that a greater variations of carbon emission amount among racial groups, housing types, income levels, employment status followed by education achievement. It suggests that marginalized groups show higher quantity carbon emissions than the higher-income and white-only groups. The number of vehicles per household and annual household income are the two most important variables to impact the potential carbon mitigation cost for both scenarios, with education, race, and housing types less relevant. The lower-income drivers face a higher financial cost to switch to EV. The third study aims to investigate the spatial association between current electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) availability and socioeconomic status of different areas within metropolitan areas. We choose six metropolitan areas in the U.S.: Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, and Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta. The EVSE location data are from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, and the demographic and socioeconomic data are from the 2020 Census and the 2019 American Community Survey. After testing several geospatial statistics methods, we found that Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models offer better performance than Ordinary Least Square models. Results show heterogeneity among cities and neighborhoods. In general, we found that current EVSE density distributions are spatially correlated with certain socioeconomic variables in various cities: housing density (except San Francisco), poverty (except Los Angeles and San Francisco), and employment rate (except San Francisco and Detroit) are mainly negatively associated with EVSE densities, while rental rate (except San Francisco) and median household incomes (except Portland and Atlanta) are positively associated. White-only variable shows no significant relationship in all six metropolitan areas. Overall, availability and accessibility of EVSE in marginalized communities needs to be improved. These studies and the methodologies could shed light for EV policymakers to better understand the equity implications of vehicular electrification, to equip with different quantitative methods to evaluate the policies present, and to improve the policies to achieve equity and climate goals in the future.",academic,2025-02-25 09:03:08.021706+01:00,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,,PQDT:68428764,,,,,,"Driving Electric with Equity: A Survey of Current Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, Policies and Planning",drivingelectricwithequityasurveyofcurrentelectricvehicleinfrastructurepoliciesandplanning,2022.0,,,[],"{'wos': {'AU': ['Sa, Boyang'], 'BN': '9798351439402', 'C1': 'University of Washington, Urban Design and Planning, Washington, United; States', 'C3': ['University of Washington'], 'DT': 'Dissertation/Thesis', 'PD': 'Jan 01 2022', 'PT': 'B', 'PY': '2022', 'TC': '0', 'TI': 'Driving Electric with Equity: A Survey of Current Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, Policies and Planning', 'UT': 'PQDT:68428764', 'Z8': '0', 'Z9': '0', 'ZA': '0', 'ZB': '0', 'ZR': '0', 'ZS': '0'}}",3798656b-31b3-4f62-85cb-13b0302bd9b0,1.0,0.0,sirui.zhu,"Electric vehicles (EV) and the electrification of the transportation sector is critical to reduce carbon emission.

The third study aims to investigate the spatial association between current electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) availability and socioeconomic status of different areas within metropolitan areas. We choose six metropolitan areas in the U.S.: Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, and Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta. The EVSE location data are from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, and the demographic and socioeconomic data are from the 2020 Census and the 2019 American Community Survey. After testing several geospatial statistics methods, we found that Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models offer better performance than Ordinary Least Square models. Results show heterogeneity among cities and neighborhoods. In general, we found that current EVSE density distributions are spatially correlated with certain socioeconomic variables in various cities: housing density (except San Francisco), poverty (except Los Angeles and San Francisco), and employment rate (except San Francisco and Detroit) are mainly negatively associated with EVSE densities, while rental rate (except San Francisco) and median household incomes (except Portland and Atlanta) are positively associated. White-only variable shows no significant relationship in all six metropolitan areas. Overall, availability and accessibility of EVSE in marginalized communities needs to be improved. These studies and the methodologies could shed light for EV policymakers to better understand the equity implications of vehicular electrification, to equip with different quantitative methods to evaluate the policies present, and to improve the policies to achieve equity and climate goals in the future."

The major US energy sources of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas); biofuels (ethanol); and wind are concentrated in grassland ecosystems of the Great Plains.

In this review, we present the ecological effects of energy development and production on grassland systems. We then identify opportunities to mitigate these effects during the planning, construction, and production phases by using informed methodology and improved technology. Primary effects during energy development include small- and large-scale soil disturbance and vegetation removal as small patches of grasslands are used to host oil or gas wells, wind turbine pads, associated roadways, and pipelines or through the conversion of large grassland areas to biofuel croplands. Direct habitat loss or habitat fragmentation can affect wildlife directly through increased mortality or indirectly through reduction in habitat quantity and quality. During energy production, air and water quality can be affected through regular emissions or unplanned spills. Energy development can also affect the economy and health of local communities. During planning, energy development and production effects can be reduced by carefully considering effects on grasslands during siting and even by selecting different energy source types.

In an online survey conducted at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in Slovenia (April 15-25, 2020), 830 Slovenian residents aged 18-85 years reported the effects of stressors (confinement, problems at home, problems at work, lack of necessities, and increased workload), experienced emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, changes in health, fatigue and sleep quality, and perceived changes in cognition during the epidemic. Risk factors for stress (neuroticism, vulnerability, general health, gender, and age) were also recorded. We hypothesized that stressors and stress risk factors will be related to subjective cognitive decline, with negative emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, and physical symptoms acting as mediator variables. On average, the results showed a mild subjective cognitive decline during the epidemic. In structural equation modeling, 34% of its variance was predicted by the mediator variables, with negative emotions and physical symptoms having the largest contribution. Stress risk factors were predictably related to the four mediator variables. Among the stressors, confinement showed the strongest effect on the four mediator variables, implying the importance of thoughtful communication about necessary restrictive measures during emergency circumstances.

However, VOCs activity and the impact on air quality and human health have scarcely been investigated. We conducted online measurement of VOCs in urban Lhasa during May 2019. The mean mixing ratio (with one standard deviation) of the total VOCs was 21.5 +/- 18.6 ppb. Of the total VOCs, alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for 57.7%, 20.9%, and 21.4%, respectively. On the basis of VOC atmospheric reactivity, the ozone formation potential (OFP) and hydroxyl radical loss rate (L ( OH )) were 91.7 ppb and 3.1 s(-1), respectively. Alkenes accounted for the largest proportion of the OFP and L ( OH ) , followed by aromatic hydrocarbons. The results of correlation analysis on the benzene series (BTEX), and the similarity of the diurnal changes in CO, NOy, BTEX, and TVOC mixing ratios indicated that Lhasa city strongly affected by motor vehicle emissions. Source apportionments using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model further confirmed that traffic related emissions, including gasoline automobiles, diesel vehicles, and public transportation vehicles fueled with liquid natural gas contributed the most in total VOCs concentration (44.5%-50.2%), L ( OH ) (41.6%-46.8%) and OFP (47.4%-52.3%). Biomass combustion, mainly from the traditional biomass fuel in the plateau, was the second contributor to ambient VOCs (41.3%), L ( OH ) (26.4%), and OFP (29.7%), and existed a less variation in diurnal changes with a feature of regional background. Plants contributed only about 1.5% to the VOCs concentration but a relatively high (approximately 14.6%) L ( OH ). The noncarcinogenic risk of BTEX did not exceed the hazard quotient value, but the carcinogenic risk of benzene was 4.47 x 10(-6), indicating a potential risk."

Thus, the use of organic waste generated from various industrial sectors can help to produce gaseous fuels through anaerobic digestion, photo and dark fermentation, and other biochemical strategies. Current biogas and biohydrogen production practices are less efficient and require additional interventions for biofuel yield improvement. In this regard, adding biochar has shown to enhancing gaseous fuel yield by about 5%-400%, adsorbing inhibitors such as ammonia, pathogens, hydrogen sulfide, and activating gas-producing mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms. This review provides recent updates and future perspectives associated with the effect of biochar on gaseous biofuel production and its underlying mechanism. Further, there is a need for establishing a circular bioeconomy approach for biochar production and utilization through a 'waste-chain', for which a techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment are required.

An immediate impact of disturbances on forest ecosystems is the creation of numerous large and small canopy gaps, which dramatically affect forest structure and function. Yet, we know little about the effect of canopy gaps on forest successional trajectory. More specifically, the responses of seedlings from different successional stages to increased light intensity under large and small canopy gaps in understory remain unclear. In this study, dominant tree seedlings from early-, mid-, and late-successional stages were selected, respectively from a tropical montane forest in Hainan Island, China to study their growth rate, biomass and traits. Our results showed that the light condition under small canopy gaps (SG, 10-15% of full sunlight) and large canopy gaps (LG, 40-50% of full sunlight) induced greater increment of relative growth rates for seedlings from early- and mid-successional stages relative to that in late-successional stage. Both SG and LG also significantly increased photosynthesis rate, leaf area (LA), light saturation point (LSP), root mass ratio (RMR) and root: shoot ratio, but decreased specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings across successional stages. Tree seedlings from the early-successional stage displayed the greatest decrease in leaf mass ratio, increase in LA, LSP, and RMR, in comparison to those from mid- and late- successional stages. Light condition and SLA were the most important factors for seedlings' relative growth rate across successional stages.

The presence of nitrate ions, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand in greywater poses excellent environmental and health risks when disposed untreated. Water scarcity directly impacts water and food security and is expected to intensify at the current resources management practices. The significance of the current and predictable water shortage in the context of sustainable development and the presence of new technologies brought further attention to utilizing non-conventional water sources. Reclamation of treated wastewater, greywater, brackish, and seawater desalination is Jordan's water budget's only non-conventional water resource. This study aims to address Jordan's water scarcity crisis by developing a low-energy, solar-powered greywater filtration system using natural materials while ensuring compliance with Jordanian standards for safe agricultural applications.METHODS: Several treatment methods have been proposed; however, most of these systems require high to medium energy levels for treatment purposes.

Studying the dielectric properties of biosolids is fundamental to understand the behaviour of this material under microwave irradiation and to design microwave assisted pyrolysis systems. This study examined the dielectric properties of biosolids with changes in moisture content and applied microwave frequency. Results demonstrated that the dielectric constant decreases with decreasing moisture content and with increasing microwave frequency, but the dielectric loss factor of dry biosolids is almost zero. Simulations demonstrated that moisture content of biosolids impacts on the distribution and intensity of electromagnetic field. Because of the poor dielectric properties of dry biosolids, a microwave susceptor must be added to the biosolids to attract microwave energy so that the materials can reach temperatures required for pyrolysis. Therefore, this study also investigated the impact of four microwave susceptors (activated carbon, charcoal, biochar and glycerol) on biosolids pyrolysis and on biochar properties produced from biosolids via microwave assisted pyrolysis at 600 degrees C.

The potential loss of this carbon sink would mark a significant reduction in the value of ecosystem services to the coastal zone and hence the understanding of the effects of multiple stressors on common algae is timely and important.    The importance of this research is based on the novel application of multiple stressors on intertidal macroalgal communities. This project will improve fundamental understanding of intertidal macroalgal ecology under the pressures of global change. Specifically, their responses to changes in dose and sequence of multiple stressors. These responses will be examined both in the lab followed by in the field to understand the impacts on associated communities and combined with other research to predict distributional changes of key intertidal algal species. This has importance for intertidal ecology and the ecosystem services that such systems provide to society. Information from this work will have both commercial (seaweed harvesting) and management and regulation (SNH, Marine Science Scotland) for the future resilience and protection of these habitats. Output from this research has implications for seaweed harvesting in Scotland. Significant changes in seaweed distribution and health could have detrimental impacts on small and isolated communities."

Among the materials, the use of biomass has been increased due to low costs, technical feasibility, and environmental benefits. The goal of the present study was to study the adsorption of Cd(II) and Ni(II) ions using a biomass from contaminated sites. The effect of pH, metal ion concentration, biomass pretreatment, and time in batch were evaluated. The biomass was analyzed in Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were evaluated.

Anxiety, however, is an evolved emotional response that can provide protection in the face of risk. Pandemics are characterized by increased mortality risk coupled with future uncertainties, which both cause heightened anxiety. Here, we examine the factors associated with anxiety levels and risk avoidance behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked how individual time perspectives (future-oriented consideration and attention to present moment experience) affect anxiety in uncertain times, and whether anxiety reduces mortality risk by promoting risk avoidance behaviour. Methodology: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3935) and measured participants' generalized and pandemic-related anxiety levels, future-oriented consideration, mindfulness, intolerance of uncertainty, risk perception and risk avoidance behaviours. Results: We found that people less tolerant of uncertainties had higher levels of pandemic anxiety. Those with higher pandemic anxiety exhibited risk avoidance behaviours more frequently. Mindfulness and increased financial satisfaction reduced pandemic anxiety. People in Turkey reported higher levels of generalized and pandemic anxiety and greater engagement in risk avoidance behaviours than people in the UK. Conclusions and implications: Our study shows an elevated anxiety response can help mitigate infection risk during pandemics and emphasizes the importance of the underlying situation in understanding whether an anxiety response is adaptive or pathological.

Vermicomposting is useful for conversion of toxic TWS into sanitized nutrient-enriched product for agricultural application. However, interactions among microbes and heavy metals are yet to be studied in Eisenia fetida incubated TWS-based vermireactors. The prime research hypotheses/objectives were to identify the most favorable feedstock combination for efficient vermiremediation; to generate novel information about the microbe-metal interaction during vermicomposting; and justify the functionality E. fetida by studying the TWS-induced shift in microbial community structure, nutrient dynamics, and metal removal. Earthworm population increased by 2.58–2.67 folds in TWS vermibeds. Water soluble and exchangeable fractions of potentially toxic metals (Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu) considerably reduced by 48–69%. The alkalinity in TWS-dominated feedstocks [TWS + CD (3:1 and 2:1)] was also significantly neutralized with substantial reduction in organic C and increase in NPK availability. Microbial biomass C and different enzyme activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, urease, phosphatase, sulphatase, and glucosidase) substantially increased in the TWS-vermibeds. Interestingly, PLFA and species diversity analyses revealed that microbial community structure and fatty acid profiles greatly alter depending on the TWS proportion in the feedstocks and the metal-induced stress on microbial communities was substantially low in TWS + CD (1:1) feedstock. The correlation statistics explained that microbial activity and growth have strongly suppressed heavy metal bioavailability in TWS-vermibeds.

Vermicomposting is useful for conversion of toxic TWS into sanitized nutrient-enriched product for agricultural application. However, interactions among microbes and heavy metals are yet to be studied in Eisenia fetida incubated TWS-based vermireactors. The prime research hypotheses/objectives were to identify the most favorable feedstock combination for efficient vermiremediation; to generate novel information about the microbe-metal interaction during vermicomposting; and justify the functionality E. fetida by studying the TWS-induced shift in microbial community structure, nutrient dynamics, and metal removal. Earthworm population increased by 2.58–2.67 folds in TWS vermibeds. Water soluble and exchangeable fractions of potentially toxic metals (Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu) considerably reduced by 48–69%. The alkalinity in TWS-dominated feedstocks [TWS + CD (3:1 and 2:1)] was also significantly neutralized with substantial reduction in organic C and increase in NPK availability. Microbial biomass C and different enzyme activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, urease, phosphatase, sulphatase, and glucosidase) substantially increased in the TWS-vermibeds. Interestingly, PLFA and species diversity analyses revealed that microbial community structure and fatty acid profiles greatly alter depending on the TWS proportion in the feedstocks and the metal-induced stress on microbial communities was substantially low in TWS + CD (1:1) feedstock. The correlation statistics explained that microbial activity and growth have strongly suppressed heavy metal bioavailability in TWS-vermibeds. Overall, the results indicate that TWS + CD (2:1 and 1:1) mixtures were favorable substrates for Eisenia fetida and microbial proliferation. The study revealed new information on microbial influence on metal remediation during vermicomposting and the results suggests that E. fetida could be utilized as a potential candidate for vermiremediation of toxic TWS."

Therefore, the search for a reasonable carbonization method can not only alleviate the pressure of global plastic pollution, but also produce considerable economic value. Here it is found that microwave cross-linking can promote the substitution of hydrogen atom in the polymer master chain of DSMs by hydrogen atom, which can reorganize the easily cracked DSMs into sp2-hybridized aromatic carbon, it can maintain 51.2 % carbon yield at1000..

Many users are interested in mapping turbidity using remote sensing tools for long-term and large-scale monitoring. This study aims to derive turbidity maps in an urbanizing city and to identify the driving factors for better decision-making and water quality management. Taking Wuhan, the most rapidly urbanizing metropolis in central China, as an instance, the water turbidity is monitored using Landsat observations from 1987 to 2019, and the relationships of turbidity and climatic/human factors are examined. Climatic factors are represented by meteorological conditions (rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and water vapor pressure) and human factors are characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and impervious surface area (ISA). The results demonstrated that: (1) the seasonal mean turbidity increased from spring to summer (34.28 NTU to 36.27 NTU), decreased in autumn (25.04 NTU), and increased again in winter (37.20 NTU), and the variations were related to changes in rainfall; and (2) the annual mean turbidity was fluctuatingly stable during 1987-2004 and decreased by 1 NTU/yr. since 2005.

On the basis of daily meteorological data from 479 observation stations, we investigate changes in ET0 and associated climate factors across the main grain-producing area (MGPA) of China from 1960 to 2015. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were applied to detect trends in ET0, and regression analyses and composite analyses were used to evaluate the contributions of climatic variables and large-scale anomalies that may affect ET0.

However, we have a limited understanding about which local factors influence tree mortality patterns, restricting our ability to predict tree mortality, especially within topographically complex tropical landscapes with a matrix of mature and secondary forests. We investigated the effects of two major local factors, topography and forest successional type, on climate-induced tropical tree mortality patterns using an observational and modeling approach. The northernmost Neotropical dry forest endured an unprecedented episode of frost-induced tree mortality after the historic February 2011 cold wave hit northwestern Mexico. In a moderately hilly landscape covering mature and secondary tropical dry forests, we surveyed 454 sites for the presence or absence of frost-induced tree mortality. In addition, across forty-eight 1 ha plots equally split into the two forest types, we examined 6,981 woody plants to estimate a frost-disturbance severity metric using the density of frost-killed trees. Elevation is the main factor modulating frost effects regardless of forest type. Higher occurrence probabilities of frost-induced tree mortality at lowland forests can be explained by the strong influence of elevation on temperature distribution since heavier cold air masses move downhill during advective frosts. Holding elevation constant, the probability of frost-induced tree mortality in mature forests was twice that of secondary forests but severity showed the opposite pattern, suggesting a cautious use of occurrence probabilities of tree mortality to infer severity of climate-driven disturbances. Extreme frost events, in addition to altering forest successional pathways and ecosystem services, likely maintain and could ultimately shift latitudinal and altitudinal range margins of Neotropical dry forests.",academic,,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,d48fc662-05a9-4b98-8330-256848c1032f,10.1111/gcb.14775,WOS:000482780200001,,,,31344294.0,,Understanding and predicting frost-induced tropical tree mortality patterns,understandingandpredictingfrostinducedtropicaltreemortalitypatterns,2019.0,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,[],"{'wos': {'AB': 'Extreme climatic and weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity across the world causing episodes of widespread tree mortality in many forested ecosystems.

The northernmost Neotropical dry forest endured an unprecedented episode of frost-induced tree mortality after the historic February 2011 cold wave hit northwestern Mexico. In a moderately hilly landscape covering mature and secondary tropical dry forests, we surveyed 454 sites for the presence or absence of frost-induced tree mortality. In addition, across forty-eight 1 ha plots equally split into the two forest types, we examined 6,981 woody plants to estimate a frost-disturbance severity metric using the density of frost-killed trees. Elevation is the main factor modulating frost effects regardless of forest type. Higher occurrence probabilities of frost-induced tree mortality at lowland forests can be explained by the strong influence of elevation on temperature distribution since heavier cold air masses move downhill during advective frosts. Holding elevation constant, the probability of frost-induced tree mortality in mature forests was twice that of secondary forests but severity showed the opposite pattern, suggesting a cautious use of occurrence probabilities of tree mortality to infer severity of climate-driven disturbances.

Results revealed that biomass accumulation of different tree components was 62.50%-74.09% in stem; 6.59%-9.14% in branch; 3.18%-5.73% in leaves; 12.20%-20.44% in stump roots; and 1.71%-3.48% in fine roots across the planting geometries.

Results revealed that biomass accumulation of different tree components was 62.50%-74.09% in stem; 6.59%-9.14% in branch; 3.18%-5.73% in leaves; 12.20%-20.44% in stump roots; and 1.71%-3.48% in fine roots across the planting geometries. The mean carbon content of the stem, branch, leaves, and roots was 49.00, 47.00, 43.00, and 49.00%, respectively. Over the 8-year period, geometry of 3 x 3 m performed better in terms of total biomass production (344.60 Mg ha- 1 by tree biomass and 62.53 Mg ha-1 by intercrops). The independent parameter, DBH2H (DBH: diameter at breast height and H: tree height), was found to be a very good predictor of dry weight, followed by DBH alone. Among various functions (linear, allometric, logistic, Gompertz, Chapman, and exponential), the best-fit equation was allometric, i.e., B = 300.96 x DBH2H0.93 (adjusted R2 = 0.96) for eucalyptus based on universal model adequacy and validation criteria. The carbon sequestration rate was maximum (20.79 Mg C ha-1 year-1) in 3 x 3 m followed by 17 x 1 x 1 m. The total carbon stock of eucalyptus-based system (tree + crop + soil) varied significantly under different planting geometries and sole crop rotation (dhaincha-barley). The higher carbon stock (237.27 Mg ha-1) was obtained from 3 x 3 m spacing and further partitioning carbon stock in trees-166.29 Mg ha-1, crops-25.01 Mg ha-1 and soil-45.97 Mg ha-1. The paired row spacing (17 x 1 x 1 m) yielded higher crop yield and net returns (Rs. 600,475 ha-1), underscoring wide spacing's role in system productivity and sustainability. Tree-based systems were valuable components of agriculture, advocating for their widespread adoption to reduce CO2 emissions and generate income through carbon credits. These findings will provide crucial insights into sustainable land-use practices and advance India's commitment toward adaptation of climate change mitigation strategies."", 'AR': '1386035', 'AU': ['Chavan, S.

However, the mismatch between power demand, resources, and generation facilities in different regions of China creates enormous carbon reduction pressures, especially in the region covered by China's Northeast Power Grid (NE Grid). Therefore, in this study, a two-stage power optimization model considering Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) was established to optimize the national power generation and transmission in China from 2020 to 2060 first and then to optimize the regional road map of energy structure adjustment for China's NE grid and its CO2 storage strategy. The first stage optimization results show that the national power interaction in China can make full use of the energy resource advantages of the NE grid, especially Jilin and Mengdong, delivering clean electricity to the North China grid as it reaches its ""dual carbon"" goal.

However, adaptions of microbial physiological and metabolic processes to the stoichiometric limitations and the resulting effects on soil carbon (C) dynamics are still poorly understood. The main aims here were to understand how microbial metabolic limitation is affected by interactions of forest gaps and mean annual precipitation in relation to plant and soil physiochemical properties, and how the metabolisms impact rates of key soil processes such as soil microbial respiration.MethodsWe compared microbial physiological adaptive traits (metabolic limitation, C use efficiency (CUE) and extracellular enzyme activities) and respiration rate between harvested gaps and unharvested stands within Robinia pseudoacacia plantations along the mean annual precipitation gradient in northern Shaanxi, China.ResultsForest gaps strengthened metabolic limitation for soil microbes, as well as their dependence on mean annual precipitation. Plant biomass (58.9%) predominantly accounted for variations in microbial relative C limitation, while soil water content (29.1%), dissolved nutrient availability and stoichiometry (52.0%) were primary predictors for microbial P limitation.

Planting also requires significant investment to ensure successful seedling establishment. However, initial seedling growth and survival is a common missing link in forest growth and yield models as they are predominantly designed to project established trees often post canopy closure. The multitude of both biotic and abiotic factors that influence growth and mortality of planted seedlings during the establishment phase is less examined. This is likely due to the high variability and complexity of this type of analysis, as well as the general lack of available data. The current study utilized annual measurements of 13,701 seedlings beginning immediately after planting to evaluate growth and mortality of planted interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mirb.] Franco) and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) seedlings across multiple contrasting sites in northern Idaho and eastern Oregon for the first two years. Our results indicate that growth and mortality of seedlings were strongly influenced by their initial diameter and height such that slimmer and taller seedlings had higher mortality, while diameter and height growth was positively related to initial diameter and height, respectively. Weather conditions, especially measures of temperature and precipitation, had a similarly important role on seedling growth and mortality. The effects of root growth potential and competing vegetation were generally insignificant as pre-planting chemical preparation was applied to all sites. Improved western larch seedlings from seed orchards had higher growth rates with small increases in mortality compared to wild collected sources, but improved Douglas-fir had minimal gains in growth and much higher mortality. The developed seedling models readily fit into the architecture of current individual tree growth and yield models, which extend these models' ability to forecast seedlings during and after establishment. The identified influential factors and specific differences in seedling growth and mortality during the establishment phase provide critical information and guidance to the increasingly important reforestation practice of planting, and the overall analytical framework presented in this analysis is generally applicable to species beyond Douglas-fir and western larch."

Alum is the most widely used coagulant, however, the use of ferric chloride (FeCl3) is gaining popularity. Drinking water production that uses FeCl3 as coagulant produces waste sludge rich in iron. We hypothesised that the iron-rich drinking water sludge (DWS) can potentially be used in the urban wastewater system to reduce dissolved sulfide in sewer systems, aid phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and reduce hydrogen sulfide in the anaerobic digester biogas. This hypothesis was investigated using two laboratory-scale urban wastewater systems, one as an experimental system and the other as a control, each comprising sewer reactors, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for wastewater treatment, sludge thickeners and anaerobic digestion reactors. Both were fed with domestic wastewater. The experimental system received in-sewer DWS-dosing at 10 mgFe L-1 while the control had none. The sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer effluent decreased by 3.5 +/- 0.2 mgS L-1 as compared with the control, while the phosphate concentration decreased by 3.6 +/- 0.3 mgP L-1 after biological wastewater treatment in the experimental SBR. The dissolved sulfide concentration in the experimental anaerobic digester also decreased by 15.9 +/- 0.9 mgS L-1 following the DWS-dosing to the sewer reactors. The DWS-doing also enhanced the settleability of the mixed liquor suspended sludge (MLSS) (SVI decreased from 193.2 +/- 22.2 to 108.0 +/- 7.7 ml g(-1)), and the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge (the cake solids concentration increased from 15.7 +/- 0.3% to 19.1 +/- 1.8%). The introduction of DWS into the experimental system significantly increased the COD and TSS concentrations in the wastewater, and consequently the MLSS concentration in the SBR, however, this did not affect normal operation. The results demonstrated that iron-rich waste sludge from drinking water production can be used in the urban wastewater system achieving multiple benefits.

In clinical practice, doctors diagnose depression primarily based on self-reported scores, which can be highly subjective. Therefore, developing a framework for diagnosing and identifying depression is a highly significant study. However, existing studies in this field face the challenges of lack of sample size and multimodal data fusion due to difficulties in obtaining patient data. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal graph neural network-based model for depression detection. In this model, we solve the few-shot learning problem based on a GNN, which can recursively aggregate and transform neighboring nodes to refine the node representation and is very effective for few-shot learning. For multimodal fusion in depression recognition, a pre-fusion strategy is used to fuse three different modal features (audio, text, and video), and input them into the Bi-LSTM fusion network to learn high-level global features of multimodal information to form a multimodal fusion representation.

Gathering and recycling of food waste is the essential issue in the waste management and the interest in processing food waste arises mainly out of influence of the processes of food putrefaction on the environment. Composting of food waste encounters a number of technical challenges, arising weak physical structure of food waste with weak porosity, high content of water, low carbon-to-nitrogen relation and fast hydrolysis and accumulation of organic acids during composting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the challenges facing installations intended for food waste composting, with the purpose to their optimization with use of appropriate additives. Physico-chemical, biochemical characteristics and phytotoxicity of the produced compost has been measured. Two additives (20% biochar and 20% sawdust) were chosen from experimental variants I-XII containing different additives (biochar, Devonian sand, sawdust) in diverse concentration. The use of selected additives seems to slightly increase potential of hydrogen value and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, while decreasing electrical conductivity in comparison with control sample. The results obtained also show that the addition of biochar leads to an increase dehydrogenase, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities and addition of sawdust has a positive effect on beta-D-glucosidase, protease, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities. The phytotoxicity test shows that the compost made of food waste (control sample) and with addition of biochar is toxic to plants. By contrast, the addition of sawdust shows that the compost was not phytotoxic. In conclusion, the addition of additives does not provide unambiguous results in terms of the quality of the final product in all monitored parameters.

Gathering and recycling of food waste is the essential issue in the waste management and the interest in processing food waste arises mainly out of influence of the processes of food putrefaction on the environment. Composting of food waste encounters a number of technical challenges, arising weak physical structure of food waste with weak porosity, high content of water, low carbon-to-nitrogen relation and fast hydrolysis and accumulation of organic acids during composting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the challenges facing installations intended for food waste composting, with the purpose to their optimization with use of appropriate additives. Physico-chemical, biochemical characteristics and phytotoxicity of the produced compost has been measured. Two additives (20% biochar and 20% sawdust) were chosen from experimental variants I-XII containing different additives (biochar, Devonian sand, sawdust) in diverse concentration. The use of selected additives seems to slightly increase potential of hydrogen value and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, while decreasing electrical conductivity in comparison with control sample. The results obtained also show that the addition of biochar leads to an increase dehydrogenase, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities and addition of sawdust has a positive effect on beta-D-glucosidase, protease, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities. The phytotoxicity test shows that the compost made of food waste (control sample) and with addition of biochar is toxic to plants. By contrast, the addition of sawdust shows that the compost was not phytotoxic. In conclusion, the addition of additives does not provide unambiguous results in terms of the quality of the final product in all monitored parameters. Therefore, we can state that food waste was reduced and hygienized, and that the final product does not meet conditions for mature compost. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The KULUNDA project's research region is part of the agricultural regions ploughed and cultivated during the so-called Virgin Lands Campaign of the Soviet era. Here, cause and effect relationships between physical and chemical soil properties under different land use managements are analysed regarding climate change adaptation, reduction of greenhouse gases and a sustainable regional development. This chapter focuses on the spatial differentiation as well as intensity- and process-related assessment of selected forms of soil degradation in the research region. The region's soil degradation is characterized by changed physical and chemical soil properties besides the occurrence of water and especially wind erosion. Type and intensity of the different degradation processes vary with local environmental conditions.

Methods and analysis: This is a single-arm prospective observational study. The target population is adult (>20 years old) workers at companies that often engage in desk work; specifically, a person who sits in front of a computer for at least half their work hours. The following data will be collected: (a) participants' background characteristics; (b) participants' biological data during the 4-week observation period using sensing devices such as a camera built into the computer (pulse wave data extracted from the facial video images), a microphone built into their work computer (voice data), and a wristband-type wearable device (electrodermal activity data, body motion data, and body temperature); (c) stress, well-being, and depression rating scale assessment data.

The experiments were carried out by operating the photobioreactor in semi-continuous mode at a constant dilution rate (D = 0.3 days(-1)) uninterrupted over ten months. The TLPBR was effective at removing the main nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand, COD) with biomass productivities ranging from 28.3 g.m(-2).day(-1) to 47.3 g.m(-2).day(-1) over the different seasons of the year. In addition, the evolution of the cells' photosynthetic efficiency (photosystem II) was also analysed. The removal of the main nutrients was correlated with the changes in the microbial-bacteria consortium existing in the culture system. These microbial fluctuations were correlated with the temperature and the solar irradiance impinging on the culture surface. The most abundant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes with the most dominant order being Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales, belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria class.

However, significant changes in climate must be expected during their long concession periods. We, therefore, investigate the combined effects of climate change and PS operations on water temperature and quality, as well as extent and duration of stratification and ice cover, using a site in Switzerland. For this purpose, a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model for the two connected water bodies is run with 150years long synthetic stochastic meteorological forcing for both current and future climate conditions under two PS and two reference scenarios. The results show relevant synergistic and antagonistic effects of PS operations and climate change. For example, hypolimnion temperatures in September are projected to increase by <0.6 degrees C in a near-natural reference scenario and by 2.5 degrees C in an extended PS scenario.

Marine-driven geomorphic changes have become the predominant process influencing future beach evolution. However, in the complex geomorphic conditions of mixed artificial and natural coastlines, the mechanisms and contributions of various marine-driven factors to beach changes remain unclear. Using methods of field observations and numerical simulations by FVCOM model, this study reveals the sedimentary dynamic mechanism of straight sandy beach in the southern Shandong Peninsula (Wanpingkou beach, WPK beach). From 2005 to 2016, the northern section of WPK Beach eroded at a rate of approximately 2-3 m/year, the middle section at about 0.5-1.5 m/year, and the southern section accrued at an average rate of about 1-2 m/year, demonstrating an overall pattern of ""northern erosion and southern accretion."" During winter, the average grain size of beach sediments is about 0.5 mm with minimal variations, indicating an onshore transport trend; in summer, the average grain size is about 0.7 mm with larger variations, indicating an offshore transport trend. Offshore sediment transport correlates mainly with seasonal changes in wind direction, while alongshore sediment transport is influenced by tidal currents, wind-induced currents, and wave-induced currents. Wave-induced currents are the primary force in alongshore sediment transport with a velocity of 0.1-0.3 m/s toward southwest. Followed by tidal currents with a velocity of 0.05-0.1 m/s, and wind-induced currents with a velocity of 0-0.1 m/s, which have a relatively minor impact.

The hydration mechanism of the SAC blended cement and the impact of washed and unwashed BPPA on SAC blended cement were analyzed by XRD, XRF, SEM, FTIR, TG, and DTG. The results showed that although replacing SAC clinker with 20%-30% BPPA decreased cement strength, an appropriate amount of BPPA (10%-15%) could significantly improve the mechanical strength of SAC blended cement. Meanwhile, the fluidity of cement pastes increased, and the setting time was prolonged with increasing BPPA replacement rate. In addition, SAC blended cement prepared with untreated BPPA had better mechanical properties than composite cementitious material prepared with washed BPPA. The compressive strength of unwashed BPPA composite cementitious material in 28 days could reach 80 MPa, whereas SAC blended cement prepared with washed BPPA only reached 50 MPa.

However, current demand management methods often lack a thorough evaluation of building carbon reduction benefits and fall short in promoting grid decarbonization. This paper proposes a lowcarbon operation optimization method for buildings, with a novel DR strategy aimed at facilitating local renewable energy consumption and system-level renewables integration. Considering local and systemic renewable shares, an evaluation framework is first introduced for quantitative building energy assessment in each period. The building loads with controllable flexibilities are then grouped and aggregated based on their elasticity characteristics and probability distribution. Finally, a low-carbon optimization model is established, leveraging the DR strategy for sustainable building operations through flexible load regulation.

Moreover, carbon emissions decrease by 5.27 % at the same level of building energy consumption. Further analysis highlights that energy storage can enhance load adjustment capabilities and the potential for reducing carbon emissions.

However, this issue has been ignored in the past. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Al(III)-induced aquifer bio-clogging, the role of Al(III) in quartz sand media (SiO2) dissolution and re-precipitation in the series of aquifer columns. We determined that Al(III) resulted in serious clogging in similar to 140 h at low concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standard of China. The corresponding hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than similar to 90% in the bacteria-containing aquifer, which was similar to 30% greater than that for the bacteria-free trials. The enhanced Al(III)-related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand to form Si-O-Al(OH)n and improving microbes attachment. Microbes retention kinetic coefficients (k) of the Al recharged simulated aquifer could increase by 3.0-8.3 times. The Al(III) also enhanced biomass production and clogging by binding to microbial extracellular polymeric substances. In turn, the greater amount of biomass accelerated the Si dissolution and re-precipitation, this may potentially damage the stability of aquifer structure. The results showed that reclaimed water treated with Al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Nevertheless, selecting seed mixes and seed quantities are hard tasks in restoration projects. An interesting idea is to design seed mixes using functional traits and create a community based on limiting similarity to overlap and outcompete the invader. We aimed to test the effect of two sown communities (one created to overlap the invader niche) and three seed sowing densities to reduce the performance of the invasive grass Eragrostis plana. Location: Greenhouse experiment in the Campos Sulinos grasslands region, Southern Brazil. Methods: We created a bifactorial experiment. The first factor was the sown community, each composed of nine native grasses but with different proportions: (1) Limiting, based on limiting similarity, and (2) Balanced, where all species were sown at the same seed weight. We used leaf functional traits (Specific leaf area, leaf area, leaf dry matter content ) to design the Limiting community. The second factor was the seed density of native species, sowing twice (1) 1 g/m(2), (2) 2 g/m(2), and (3) 4 g/m(2) (i.e., total density was 2, 4, and 8 g/m(2)). E. plana was sown once at 0.5 g/m(2). Above-ground and below-ground biomass of all species were collected after nine months to assess the treatment effects. Results: Biomass production of the invasive species was lower when sown with native species. Nevertheless, both sown communities did not differently affect the invasive biomass production. Higher seed density of native species resulted in lower invasive above-ground biomass, but not below-ground biomass. Three native species did not germinate, consequently, the established communities were quite different from those designed. Conclusions: The low species germination limited our discussion about the use of limiting similarity to design seed mixes. High seed sowing density is a better approach when defining sowing strategies to compete with invasive grasses."

However, the problem of contradictory achievements in LEED and LCA has not yet been resolved. This study aimed to identify and evaluate different strategies for LEED projects using LCAs. Thirty-nine LEED projects with the same characteristics-location and transportation, rating system, rating version, certification level, and space type-were collected and sorted by their energy and atmosphere (EA) category, ""optimize energy performance "" credit (EAc6) achievement into three equal groups (EA(Low), EA(Medium), and EA(High), where each group includes 13 LEED projects) to minimize the influence of uncontrolled factors on the LEED project strategy. The author focused on two extreme groups with very different EAc6 credit scores: EA(Low) (13 projects) and EA(High) (13 projects). The groups were compared across LEED categories and credits. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Cliff's delta test results showed that the EA(Low) and EA(High) groups are associated with high/low achievements in materials-related credits such as ""interiors life cycle impact reduction "", ""building product disclosure and optimization-material ingredients "", and ""low-emitting materials "".

This paper has two objectives (i) to examine the feasibility of using participatory video with people with severe mental illness (SMI); and (ii) to assess viewer impressions of the resultant videos and subsequent subjective impact. Methods We conducted a participatory action research study with three workgroups of people with severe mental illness situated in different Canadian cities, who set out to create and disseminate locally-grounded mental-health themed videos.

Four themes emerged from six viewer focus groups (N = 30), with participants frequently noting that videos were (i) educational and informative; (ii) real and relatable; (iii) attention-grabbing; and (iv) change-inducing. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale multi-site project examining the feasibility and impact of a participatory video program for people with severe mental illness. The results indicate that participatory video is a feasible method in this population and gives preliminary evidence that resultant videos can reduce viewer stigma. Thus, participatory video should be considered a promising practice in the ongoing effort to reduce mental illness stigma."

Despite their vital roles, reservoirs are gradually being filled with sediments as land use and climate change exacerbate soil erosion and sediment transport and deposition in natural and engineered surface water systems. Few suitable sites for new dam construction exist in the United States thereby  emphasizing the need for cost-effective management of existing reservoirs. In 2024, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the State of Kansas are scheduled to pilot test a novel water-injection dredging (WID) process (an untested but potentially transformative approach) in a federal reservoir in the State of Kansas with the aim of inducing turbidity currents and exporting trapped reservoir sediments to downstream waterways, which could prove crucial for addressing the global concern of reservoir sedimentation and its impact on water security. However, key questions remain regarding the ability of WID to restore reservoir sediment storage capacity, its environmental implications to in-lake water quality, and its downstream effects to channel morphology and aquatic ecosystems. To address these knowledge gaps, the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this project propose to leverage the USACE-Kansas WID field test to collect and analyze sediments, nutrients, and aquatic species count data with the goal of generating fundamental scientific and engineering knowledge on the transport efficacy, mechanisms, and environmental responses following the implementation of WID process in a water reservoir.

The basic premise of the water-injection dredging (WID) process is to spray a jet of fluid into the bed of a reservoir, entrain sediments into the overlying water, and initiate a density current (akin to an underwater avalanche) to mobilize stored bed sediments toward the reservoir outlet. While WID has successfully been applied to ports and rivers, it has yet to be tested in a water reservoir thereby raising critical questions regarding its potential efficacy and environmental impact. This project will address these knowledge gaps. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) evaluate the physical mechanisms by which human-induced turbidity currents propagate in reservoirs, using high-frequency turbidity sensing data and computational fluid dynamics modeling; 2) evaluate shifts in reservoir water quality by monitoring thermal stratification and redox conditions using in-situ physicochemical sensors and laboratory experiments before, during, and after the WID field test; 3) assess channel and floodplain accretion rates before, during, and after the WID field test; and 4) continuously assess the response of fish and macroinvertebrate communities to sediment releases and the induced biological, chemical, and physical changes in water quality and habitats throughout the WID demonstration project.

This study provides an integrated damage, visual, remote sensing, and environmental analysis of the tornado event. Medium-resolution satellite imagery and in situ photographs of the damage show that the tornado caused high-end F2 damage on the Fujita scale across a 4.9-km-long path in the northern portion of Xanxere. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal the existence of a low-level mesocyclone and rear-flank downdraft, indicating that the storm was a supercell. Horizontal vortices, which are occasionally observed in strong tornadoes but rarely documented in Brazilian tornadoes, were also observed in the videos. The supercell developed in a warm and moist air mass characterized by moderate buoyancy and weak mid-level lapse rates. The mid- and upper-tropospheric forcing for synoptic-scale ascent was weak but the prevailing zonal flow was moderately strong, providing sufficient deep-layer shear for supercell development. A key component of the synoptic-scale environment was the presence of a northerly low-level jet stream that promoted warm moist advection into western SC in addition to increasing the low-level vertical wind shear in the region. On the mesoscale, the presence of a broad cloud shield from a decaying mesoscale convective system (MCS) preceding the supercell formation hampered daytime radiative heating over western SC resulting in low dewpoint depression and, thus, lower lifting condensation levels around Xanxere.

The green energy revolution has primarily driven this uptake amid climate change, coupled with the off-grid operability microgrids and flexibility in control. On the other hand, microgrids are inherently unpredictable, and energy security is continuously becoming critical to business continuity operation as disaster occurrences rise. Therefore, efficient energy management methods that maintain supply-demand balance have become essential to ensure the resilience of microgrids. In this paper, the authors propose a useful energy management system (EMS) tool for microgrid operators that considers non-critical load shedding, referred to as non-critical load curtailment (NLC), and photovoltaic (PV) power curtailment (PVC).

The Cenomanian Nimar Sandstone Formation, Bagh Group, Narmada rift basin, uniquely portrays the effect of sea-level rise within an intra-cratonic setting and attributes to the corresponding palaeogeographic changes in west-central India. An integrated sedimentological-sequence-stratigraphic study of the broadly fining-upward Nimar Sandstone Formation (thickness similar to 20-30m) depicts the actual nature of changeover from a fluvial to a marine-dominated transitional depositional setting. Detailed sedimentological study reveals total seventeen facies, grouped in five facies associations, viz., the channel-fill facies association (FA-1), the overbank facies association (FA-2), the fluvial-dominated fluvio-tidal facies association (FA-3), the tide-dominated fluvio-tidal facies association (FA-4), and the shoreface facies association (FA-5). Overall facies architecture indicates a west-to-eastward marine encroachment, resulting in stacking of three distinct palaeo-depositional conditions: (i) an initial fluvial system with channel and overbank, changing into a tide-influenced fluvial bay-head delta in the inner estuary, followed by (ii) marine encroachment leading to a tide-dominated central estuary with inter- to sub-tidal settings, and finally, (iii) with further intense marine encroachments, a wave-reworked open shore condition in the outer estuary zone. The overall fining-up succession with a systematic change from fluvial to marine-dominated depositional systems points to a landward shift of the shoreline, signifying a major transgressive event correlated to the Cenomanian global sea-level rise.

We are at this stage simulating the largest semidiurnal (M-2, S-2, N-2) and diurnal (K-1, O-1) tidal constituents in a single-layer version of MPAS-O. First, we show that the tidal constituents calculated using MPAS-Ocean closely agree with the results of the global tidal prediction model TPXO8 when suitably tuned topographic wave drag and bottom drag coefficients are employed. Thereafter, we present the sensitivity of global tidal evolution due to the presence of Antarctic ice shelf cavities. The effect of ice shelves on the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents are presented. Lower values of complex errors (with respect to TPXO8 results) for the M-2 tidal constituents are observed when the ice shelf is added in the simulations, with particularly strong improvement in the Southern Ocean.

We are at this stage simulating the largest semidiurnal (M-2, S-2, N-2) and diurnal (K-1, O-1) tidal constituents in a single-layer version of MPAS-O. First, we show that the tidal constituents calculated using MPAS-Ocean closely agree with the results of the global tidal prediction model TPXO8 when suitably tuned topographic wave drag and bottom drag coefficients are employed. Thereafter, we present the sensitivity of global tidal evolution due to the presence of Antarctic ice shelf cavities. The effect of ice shelves on the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents are presented. Lower values of complex errors (with respect to TPXO8 results) for the M-2 tidal constituents are observed when the ice shelf is added in the simulations, with particularly strong improvement in the Southern Ocean. Our work points towards future research with varying Antarctic ice shelf geometries and sea ice coupling that might lead to better comparison and prediction of tides and thus better prediction of sea-level rise and also the future climate variability.', 'AF': ['Pal, Nairita', 'Barton, Kristin N.', 'Petersen, Mark R.', 'Brus, Steven R.', 'Engwirda, Darren', 'Arbic, Brian K.', 'Roberts, Andrew F.', 'Westerink, Joannes J.', 'Wirasaet, Damrongsak'], 'AU': ['Pal, N', 'Barton, KN', 'Petersen, MR', 'Brus, SR', 'Engwirda, D', 'Arbic, BK', 'Roberts, AF', 'Westerink, JJ', 'Wirasaet, D'], 'BP': '1297', 'DI': '10.5194/gmd-16-1297-2023', 'EI': '1991-9603', 'EP': '1314', 'IS': '4', 'OI': ['Roberts, Andrew/0000-0002-0394-8396', 'Arbic, Brian K/0000-0002-7969-2294', 'Brus, Steven/0000-0002-0314-9201', 'Engwirda, Darren/0000-0002-3379-9109', 'Petersen, Mark/0000-0001-7170-7511'], 'PD': 'FEB 23', 'PT': 'J', 'PY': '2023', 'RI': ['Robert, Andrew/AAT-5089-2021', 'Brus, Steven/ABB-8389-2021', 'Pal, Nairita/AAK-1341-2021'], 'SN': '1991-959X', 'SO': 'GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT', 'TI': 'Barotropic tides in MPAS-Ocean (E3SM V2): impact of ice shelf cavities', 'UT': 'WOS:000937129900001', 'VL': '16'}}",4fe33667-4f13-4e16-9f6a-3832a0663d8f,1.0,0.0,danfei.shen,"Oceanic tides are seldom represented in Earth system models (ESMs) owing to the need for high horizontal resolution to accurately represent the associated barotropic waves close to coasts.

The existing literature points to self-compassion as a potential protective factor against stress and difficulties. To this end, the present study aimed to explore the potential protective role of parents' self-compassion in the prospective relationship between children's emotional regulation difficulties and parents' depressive symptoms.MethodThe initial sample consisted of 214 children (53.3% girls; Mage = 12.71, SD = 1.37) and their parents: 209 mothers (Mage = 46.74 years, SD = 4.42) and 181 fathers (Mage = 48.85 years, SD = 5.42). The participants answered self-report questionnaires in a two-wave longitudinal study conducted over one year.

The underlying mechanisms regulating the influence of afforestation on soil carbon-water dynamics, particularly how deep soil C reacts to afforestation-induced soil drying, remain largely unclear. This study examined the variations of soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in 500 cm depth along four afforestation stages: abandoned grasslands, shrublands, and 20-year and 40-year Robinia pseudoacacia forests (RP20 and RP40) in the semiarid Loess Plateau, China. The results indicated that afforestation has significantly increased SWC (+26.6%), SOC (+44.5%), and SIC (+6.5%) in the shallow layer (0-100 cm) but caused evident soil drying (-60.8%), decrease in SOC (-37.8%), and slight reduction in SIC (-0.3%) in the deep layer (300-500 cm) when compared with grasslands. The seriously decline in the coupling coordination between soil C and SWC in the middle and deep layers indicates the unsustainability of afforestation especially for RP40. Structural equation model showed that the negative impact of afforestation on deep SOC through soil water depletion (-0.38) outweighed the direct positive impact of increased aboveground biomass (AGB) (+0.33). The negative impacts of decreased SWC and increased pH on deep SIC was close to the positive impacts of AGB.

Nonetheless, it poses notable challenges concerning water depletion and soil drought in (semi)arid regions. The underlying mechanisms regulating the influence of afforestation on soil carbon-water dynamics, particularly how deep soil C reacts to afforestation-induced soil drying, remain largely unclear. This study examined the variations of soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in 500 cm depth along four afforestation stages: abandoned grasslands, shrublands, and 20-year and 40-year Robinia pseudoacacia forests (RP20 and RP40) in the semiarid Loess Plateau, China.

In addition, the durability of developed mortars, including freezing and thawing resistance, thermal resistance, acid (corrosion) resistance, flammability, and smoke production, were examined. The results revealed that lower replacement rates of cement with biochar (up to 5 wt%) do not substantially change the performance of cementitious composites.

Moving toward the outer latitudes, in particular, where snow cover is more important, surface albedo effects are perceived to overpower carbon sequestration. By raising surface albedo, deforestation is thus predicted to lead to surface cooling, while increasing forest cover is assumed to result in warming. Observational data, however, generally support the opposite conclusion, suggesting surface albedo is poorly understood. Most accept that surface temperatures are influenced by the interplay of surface albedo, incoming shortwave (SW) radiation, and the partitioning of the remaining, post-albedo, SW radiation into latent and sensible heat. However, the extent to which the avoidance of sensible heat formation is first and foremost mediated by the presence (absence) of water and TFVC is not well understood. TFVC both mediates the availability of water on the land surface and drives the potential for latent heat production (evapotranspiration, ET). While latent heat is more directly linked to local than global cooling/warming, it is driven by photosynthesis and carbon sequestration and powers additional cloud formation and top-of-cloud reflectivity, both of which drive global cooling. TFVC loss reduces water storage, precipitation recycling, and downwind rainfall potential, thus driving the reduction of both ET (latent heat) and cloud formation.

Biochar, produced by the pyrolysis process of biomass, is emerging as a powerful tool for carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and purifying water from contaminants such as potentially toxic elements and antibiotics. The review found that the biochar obtained as a result of pyrolysis of chemically modified waste rapeseed cake is characterised by its excellent sorption properties. The obtained sorbents are characterised by sorption capacity relative to the copper(II) ion, ranging from 40 mg center dot g-1 to 100 mg center dot g-1, according to the pyrolysis conditions and chemical modification method. The purified pyrolysis gas obtained in the high-temperature process can be used to generate heat and energy.

This manuscript provides a general summary of the properties of the pyrolytic products of waste rapeseed cake, with particular emphasis on the sorption properties of biochar. Biochar, produced by the pyrolysis process of biomass, is emerging as a powerful tool for carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and purifying water from contaminants such as potentially toxic elements and antibiotics. The review found that the biochar obtained as a result of pyrolysis of chemically modified waste rapeseed cake is characterised by its excellent sorption properties. The obtained sorbents are characterised by sorption capacity relative to the copper(II) ion, ranging from 40 mg center dot g-1 to 100 mg center dot g-1, according to the pyrolysis conditions and chemical modification method. The purified pyrolysis gas obtained in the high-temperature process can be used to generate heat and energy. Bio-oil, with its significant combustion heat of 36 MJ center dot kg-1, can be a source of environmentally friendly green biofuel.', 'AR': '498', 'AU': ['Mazurek, Krzysztof', 'Druzynski, Sebastian', 'Kielkowska, Urszula', 'Wrobel-Kaszanek, Adriana', 'Iglinski, Bartlomiej', 'Cichosz, Marcin'], 'C1': 'Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Chem, Gagarina 7, PL-87100 Torun,; Poland', 'DA': '2024-02-05', 'DI': '10.3390/en17020498', 'DT': 'Review', 'EI': '1996-1073', 'IS': '2', 'OI': ['Iglinski, Bartlomiej/0000-0002-2976-6371', 'Druzynski, Sebastian/0000-0002-8762-2528', 'Wrobel-Kaszanek, Adriana/0000-0001-9842-6947', 'Kielkowska, Urszula/0000-0001-7924-4291'], 'PD': 'JAN 2024', 'PT': 'J', 'PY': '2024', 'RI': ['Igliński, Bartłomiej/E-5444-2014', 'Cichosz, Marcin/E-5455-2014', 'Iglinski, Bartlomiej/', 'Druzynski, Sebastian/E-5823-2014', 'Wrobel-Kaszanek, Adriana/I-2195-2018', 'Kielkowska, Urszula/E-5871-2014'], 'SO': 'ENERGIES', 'TC': '3', 'TI': 'The Application of Pyrolysis Biochar Obtained from Waste Rapeseed Cake to Remove Copper from Industrial Wastewater: An Overview', 'UT': 'WOS:001149485000001', 'VL': '17', 'Z8': '0', 'Z9': '3', 'ZA': '0', 'ZB': '0', 'ZR': '0', 'ZS': '0'}}",,,,RESOLVED,"Pyrolysis is a thermochemical technology for converting biomass into energy and chemical products consisting of bio-gas, bio-oil, and biochar.
