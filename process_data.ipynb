However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aims Previous studies have shown that silicon (Si) can affect plant growth and yield by regulating the availability of other nutrients. However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The co-steam gasification of biomass (straw) and Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) presents a promising pathway for sustainable waste management and renewable energy production, with significant implications for environmental protection. This study investigates the co-gasification of straw and RDF to optimize syngas production and minimize undesired by-products. The optimization of the S/M ratio and gasification temperature is crucial for efficient RDF gasification. The optimal S/M ratio and temperature balance syngas yield, quality (LHV), and process efficiency (carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency), while minimizing environmental hazards from solid residues. The carbon conversion efficiency of co-gasification of RDF increased by 12.7 % at the S/ M 0 f 0.75 and gasification temperature of 800 degrees C, a significant improvement compared to the efficiencies observed for the separate gasification of straw and RDF. Additionally, the gas yield and the cold gas efficiency were increased by 14.43 % and 26.42 % compared to the separate gasification processes, respectively. These results demonstrate the synergistic effects of cogasifying straw and RDF, enhancing gasification performance and reducing tar formation. The study underscores the potential of co-steam gasification of straw and RDF as a technologically viable and environmentally friendly approach to waste-to-energy conversion, emphasizing the importance of operational optimization for achieving superior energy recovery, resource efficiency, and reduced environmental impact.</td>\n",

The demand for this product has grown in great measure in the last decade, thus it is becoming more important to make environmental and energetic evaluations of its manufacturing process. In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system's product.   \n",

       "2                                                                            Aims Previous studies have shown that silicon (Si) can affect plant growth and yield by regulating the availability of other nutrients. However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.   \n",
       "3  The co-steam gasification of biomass (straw) and Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) presents a promising pathway for sustainable waste management and renewable energy production, with significant implications for environmental protection. This study investigates the co-gasification of straw and RDF to optimize syngas production and minimize undesired by-products. The optimization of the S/M ratio and gasification temperature is crucial for efficient RDF gasification. The optimal S/M ratio and temperature balance syngas yield, quality (LHV), and process efficiency (carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency), while minimizing environmental hazards from solid residues. The carbon conversion efficiency of co-gasification of RDF increased by 12.7 % at the S/ M 0 f 0.75 and gasification temperature of 800 degrees C, a significant improvement compared to the efficiencies observed for the separate gasification of straw and RDF. Additionally, the gas yield and the cold gas efficiency were increased by 14.43 % and 26.42 % compared to the separate gasification processes, respectively. These results demonstrate the synergistic effects of cogasifying straw and RDF, enhancing gasification performance and reducing tar formation. The study underscores the potential of co-steam gasification of straw and RDF as a technologically viable and environmentally friendly approach to waste-to-energy conversion, emphasizing the importance of operational optimization for achieving superior energy recovery, resource efficiency, and reduced environmental impact.   \n",

       "2  {'wos': {'AB': \"Aims Previous studies have shown that silicon (Si) can affect plant growth and yield by regulating the availability of other nutrients. However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.\", 'AU': ['Wu, Yuntao', 'Zhang, Xiaodong', 'Lin, Jiayang', 'Wang, Xia', 'Sun, Shaobo', 'Hao, Qian', 'Wu, Lele', 'Zhou, Jingyun', 'Xia, Shaopan', 'Ran, Xiangbing', 'Wang, Yidong', 'Tang, Jiahuan', 'Yu, Changxun', 'Song, Zhaoliang', 'Liu, Cong-Qiang'], 'BP': '503', 'C1': 'Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden', 'C3': ['Tianjin Key Lab Earth Crit Zone Sci & Sustainable'], 'DA': '2024-03-31', 'DI': '10.1007/s11104-024-06598-7', 'DT': 'Article', 'EA': 'MAR 2024', 'EI': '1573-5036', 'EP': '516', 'IS': '1-2', 'OI': ['Wu, Yuntao/0009-0005-1659-811X', 'Wang, Yidong/0000-0002-5399-2803'], 'PD': 'OCT 2024', 'PT': 'J', 'PY': '2024', 'RI': ['Song, Zhaoliang/J-9613-2014', 'zhang, xiaodong/HNS-5895-2023', 'Yu, Changxun/F-9528-2013', 'Wu, Yuntao/', 'Wang, Yidong/I-4027-2014'], 'SI': 'SI', 'SN': '0032-079X', 'SO': 'PLANT AND SOIL', 'TC': '0', 'TI': 'Silicon promotes biomass accumulation in <i>Phragmites australis</i> under waterlogged conditions in coastal wetland', 'UT': 'WOS:001182513700001', 'VL': '503', 'Z8': '0', 'Z9': '0', 'ZA': '0', 'ZB': '0', 'ZR': '0', 'ZS': '0'}}   \n",

In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system's product.  \n",

However, the mechanisms by which Si affects plant biomass accumulation in coastal wetlands are not well explored. Methods We conducted a sampling campaign across the whole growing season of Phragmites australis under waterlogging and drought conditions in coastal wetland, and quantified the effects of Si availability on biomass accumulation. Results Compared with drought condition, the waterlogged condition improved the utilization efficiency of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of P. australis regulated by higher Si contents. Meanwhile, the increased Si contents promoted the utilization of N and P in leaf, suggesting that the increase in Si contents optimizes the photosynthetic process. Lignin contents in P. australis decreased with the increasing Si contents, which confirmed that Si can replace structural carbon components. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) showed aboveground biomass accumulation of P. australis was synchronized with Si accumulation, indicating that Si was a beneficial element to promote biomass accumulation. Conclusions Our study implies that increasing Si availability is conducive to biomass accumulation of P. australis in waterlogged wetlands, which will provide important scientific references for the management of coastal wetland ecosystem and the increase of global 'blue carbon' sequestration.  \n",
       "3  The co-steam gasification of biomass (straw) and Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) presents a promising pathway for sustainable waste management and renewable energy production, with significant implications for environmental protection. This study investigates the co-gasification of straw and RDF to optimize syngas production and minimize undesired by-products. The optimization of the S/M ratio and gasification temperature is crucial for efficient RDF gasification. The optimal S/M ratio and temperature balance syngas yield, quality (LHV), and process efficiency (carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency), while minimizing environmental hazards from solid residues. The carbon conversion efficiency of co-gasification of RDF increased by 12.7 % at the S/ M 0 f 0.75 and gasification temperature of 800 degrees C, a significant improvement compared to the efficiencies observed for the separate gasification of straw and RDF. Additionally, the gas yield and the cold gas efficiency were increased by 14.43 % and 26.42 % compared to the separate gasification processes, respectively. These results demonstrate the synergistic effects of cogasifying straw and RDF, enhancing gasification performance and reducing tar formation. The study underscores the potential of co-steam gasification of straw and RDF as a technologically viable and environmentally friendly approach to waste-to-energy conversion, emphasizing the importance of operational optimization for achieving superior energy recovery, resource efficiency, and reduced environmental impact.  \n",

       "top     Coffee is the beverage resulting from the infusion of roasted and ground seeds of the coffee fruit. It is one of the most commercialized products in the world and represents a high interest agro-industrial product in Mexico. The demand for this product has grown in great measure in the last decade, thus it is becoming more important to make environmental and energetic evaluations of its manufacturing process. In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system's product.   \n",

       "top     {'wos': {'AB': \"Coffee is the beverage resulting from the infusion of roasted and ground seeds of the coffee fruit. It is one of the most commercialized products in the world and represents a high interest agro-industrial product in Mexico. The demand for this product has grown in great measure in the last decade, thus it is becoming more important to make environmental and energetic evaluations of its manufacturing process. In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system's product.\", 'AF': ['Giraldi-Diaz, Mario R.', 'De Medina-Salas, Lorena', 'Castillo-Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Leon-Lira, Rosario'], 'AR': '4598', 'AU': ['Giraldi-Díaz, MR', 'De Medina-Salas, L', 'Castillo-González, E', 'León-Lira, R'], 'DI': '10.3390/su10124598', 'EI': '2071-1050', 'IS': '12', 'OI': ['Leon Lira, Maria del Rosario/0000-0001-6773-2036', 'Giraldi, Mario R./0000-0003-0390-9925', 'De Medina-Salas, Lorena/0000-0001-7423-7455', 'Castillo Gonzalez, Eduardo/0000-0002-3180-4373'], 'PD': 'DEC', 'PT': 'J', 'PY': '2018', 'RI': ['González, Eduardo/AET-0266-2022', 'De Medina-Salas, Lorena/AAA-5160-2022', 'Giraldi, Mario R./E-7216-2019'], 'SO': 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'TI': 'Environmental Impact Associated with the Supply Chain and Production of Grounding and Roasting Coffee through Life Cycle Analysis', 'UT': 'WOS:000455338100264', 'VL': '10'}}   \n",

       "top     Coffee is the beverage resulting from the infusion of roasted and ground seeds of the coffee fruit. It is one of the most commercialized products in the world and represents a high interest agro-industrial product in Mexico. The demand for this product has grown in great measure in the last decade, thus it is becoming more important to make environmental and energetic evaluations of its manufacturing process. In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system's product.  \n",

       "405    Food waste has recently gained much worldwide interest due to its influence on the environment, economy and society. Gathering and recycling of food waste is the essential issue in the waste management and the interest in processing food waste arises mainly out of influence of the processes of food putrefaction on the environment. Composting of food waste encounters a number of technical challenges, arising weak physical structure of food waste with weak porosity, high content of water, low carbon-to-nitrogen relation and fast hydrolysis and accumulation of organic acids during composting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the challenges facing installations intended for food waste composting, with the purpose to their optimization with use of appropriate additives. Physico-chemical, biochemical characteristics and phytotoxicity of the produced compost has been measured. Two additives (20% biochar and 20% sawdust) were chosen from experimental variants I-XII containing different additives (biochar, Devonian sand, sawdust) in diverse concentration. The use of selected additives seems to slightly increase potential of hydrogen value and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, while decreasing electrical conductivity in comparison with control sample. The results obtained also show that the addition of biochar leads to an increase dehydrogenase, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities and addition of sawdust has a positive effect on beta-D-glucosidase, protease, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities. The phytotoxicity test shows that the compost made of food waste (control sample) and with addition of biochar is toxic to plants. By contrast, the addition of sawdust shows that the compost was not phytotoxic. In conclusion, the addition of additives does not provide unambiguous results in terms of the quality of the final product in all monitored parameters. Therefore, we can state that food waste was reduced and hygienized, and that the final product does not meet conditions for mature compost. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",
